I didn't even have an idea, but there's this one expert that had some experience in environmental policy in Cambodia, whom I requested; however, who also decided that Miami was a better way to spend her Tuesday. Fair enough. Instead, I got the pleasant experience of sitting down with Sara Haq, who was on a trip to Wharton to meet with students. After chatting about random topics, it was really clear that Sara had very extensive advice for anybody considering an international career. I decided request to interview her and here's what we learned.*\n\n<div id=\"small-interests\"></div>\n**Before we start, would you like to share one cool thing that you think is important about you that I wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else?**\n\nActually, you can find a LOT about me online, especially on my blog on [my company website](http://www.shinternational.us). On a personal level, I really love to cook, and I really like to meet people. It's interesting how as an entrepreneur, you can work a little bit of your personal interests into everything that you do. Here's a funny story. I used to have a lot of food companies as clients, because I am really passionate about food and have a good sense of what types of foods will be popular in specific overseas markets. But a lot of their foods were really high calorie. So, with all of food samples I was evaluating, I started to gain weight, so I eventually stopped actively looking for new food companies to work with. So as an entrepreneur, your personal interests and preferences will start to intertwine with your business. \n\n**Can you talk broadly about your international experience?**\n\nWhen I worked for the [International Finance Corporation (IFC)](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home), I had the opportunity to work with investments across Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, Central Asia and South Asia. I thought leaving the IFC meant that I would not have these opportunities anymore, but have been relieved to find out that this is not the case!\n\nSince leaving, I have had the chance to support women entrepreneurs and leaders in Tanzania, share insights at a [food investment conference in Uzbekistan](http://www.food-exhibitions.com/WorldFood-Uzbekistan), help US companies get partnerships in the United Arab Emirates and in Turkey, and even help foreign companies, like an Indian ICT company we helped position for entry into Central Asia. I helped a technology start-up build its presence in the Philippines. I even have a Swedish entrepreneur who is an enthusiastic client of our training programs. I love my job. \n\nThe only thing that is missing is that I need to support more entrepreneurs building a presence in Latin America, because that is my favorite region of the world to do business in. I feel like I just confessed a secret. I am not supposed to have favorites. I do have a Mexican-American entrepreneur on our advisory board, and have just started exploring leveraging the resources that he brings to the table to support an Ecuadorian entrepreneur living in the US, who wants to build a business involving “both of his countries.” \n\n\n**Can you tell us about SH International? What is it? What do you enjoy about it?**\n\nSH International helps entrepreneurs build profitable multinational businesses. With access to the right expertise, deals, and relationships, entrepreneurs do not need to join the Fortune 500 before achieving profitable multinational business growth. These individuals are driven by passion and vision to build amazing global businesses outside of their current comfort zones and abilities. They do this by taking tangible steps towards achieving their goals, by attracting the resources that they need to survive and thrive, and by taking advantage of educational opportunities that fill critical gaps in their skill set. We support them in these endeavors.\n\nI enjoy almost everything about my business. Maybe what I enjoy the most is serving others of a kindred spirit. I love meeting entrepreneurs whose hunger for life and for experiencing the world compels them, over time, to push their comfort zones out to infinite.\n\n**Can you talk a bit about the difference between working abroad versus working in the US?**\n\nIn the US, people have a very systematic way of viewing the world. There are rules that you follow, and there are systems that you go through. There are regulations and guidelines. When you start doing international work, especially in emerging markets, there is not as much structure. A lot of people from the US struggle with the level of flexibility, and so-called out-of-the-box thinking necessary to survive and thrive. It can be a lot of fun to do international work with the right mind-set. In many situations, you can create your own structure, and be very creative and innovative, a perfect situation for the entrepreneurial type!\n\n**Were you entrepreneurial during your undergrad years?**\n\nNot entrepreneurial in the strict sense. I never took the entrepreneurship classes. I guess my tendency towards entrepreneurship shone through in the things that I did. For example, I was one of the five co-founders of [Phi Gamma Nu (PGN)](http://www.upenn-pgn.org/). I think I always had a streak of liking to get things done, to create something out of nothing. I liked executing so I would say yes to opportunities to be involved in something innovative or new, but I didn't take entrepreneurship courses, and I didn't do any business competitions.\n\n**Do you have any advice for college students on career paths?**\n\nAt the very beginning, my mentality was that there must be only one right answer to what I should do with my life. I used to think that you can calculate the path to take, and I searched for the right answer in investment banking or consulting. Within those, you do further soul searching to pick whether you are going to be a trader or serve in other specific functions.\n\nI used to study a lot of math. In elementary math, there was only one right answer. Either you got it right or you did not. However, as I dove into the more advanced math, sometimes there were multiple right answers to the problem. Or sometimes, there were no solutions. So, when considering what future route to take, I try to remind myself that life decisions are just like these math equations, and try not to put so much pressure on finding the one right answer. Just because you choose one answer does not necessary mean that you are right or wrong. You just made that specific decision.\n\n<div id=\"friends\"></div>\n**How did you stay informed as to your opportunities along the way?**\n\nI interviewed with a lot of companies, not by choice, but because I needed to do that to get my first job. This experience gave me a lot of exposure to the type of work out there. I definitely encourage you to do a lot of interviewing, if for no other reason than the practice is helpful.\n\nI think at a place like Wharton, you are definitely busy. There are one million opportunities that all seem really important. You do not have the luxury to pursue every interesting opportunity, or to rigorously compare them. Following your curiosity and your strengths will allow you to naturally look at things that you are the most likely to be successful in.\n\nYou have to understand that you can spend a million hours, months, years, beating yourself up about the career decisions that you will have to make. And you will not find that one answer, because there are multiple answers. You can better use that psychological energy to get, for example, better grades, and meet more people.\n\n>==One thing I wish is that I had met more people as an undergrad. It’s such a gift to be in Wharton undergrad. You can build many genuine, sincere relationships with amazing people.==\n\nWhereas, in MBA programs, people are more intentionally there for the networking and connections. I believe that you get many more sincere friendships in undergrad. And now that I think back, all of those people are doing great things. And each of those can be a unique connection that can support you in the future, and whom you can support.\n\n**What is one specific project that really stuck in your mind all these years?**\n\nOne of my first projects was helping an Indian information and communication technology client, called [Karvy Data Management Services](http://www.kdms.in/home.html), position themselves to enter Central Asia.\n \nSo there were a couple of really cool things about this project. One, the client was Adhiraj Parthasarathy, who was also one of my friends from Penn undergrad. It was just really, really fun reconnecting with a friend from college, doing a really cool project for him and with him. I think the take-away from this is that if you do the things that you are interested in at Penn, you will be surrounded by people who are likely interested in the same things, and when you leave you will have a great community to share fun opportunities with. The project itself was really fun as well. I was involved in introducing them to a lot of partners in Central Asia. From an American point of view, that was an exceptionally challenging project. \n\nI have learned to hold onto people who are supportive, like Adhiraj, and to find ways to further engage with them. This project was many years ago. However, we still work together. Adhiraj currently sits on the advisory board for SH International, and has helped me out with a number of strategic initiatives.\n\n<div id=\"pre-reqs\"></div>\n**Anything else that you want to share?**\n\nI have learned a lot in the last few years working with multinational entrepreneurs. \n\n>==I came into this game thinking that experience counted a lot more than it actually does. What I found out was that the desire to take action and get things done counts a lot more.==\n\nI have worked with so many entrepreneurs, all of whom have performed extraordinary feats without a ton of experience. If you allow a lack of experience to scare you, it is difficult to get much done.\n\n\n --------\n\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

So, with all of food samples I was evaluating, I started to gain weight, so I eventually stopped actively looking for new food companies to work with. So as an entrepreneur, your personal interests and preferences will start to intertwine with your business. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you talk broadly about your international experience?</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I worked for the <a href=\"http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home\">International Finance Corporation (IFC)</a>, I had the opportunity to work with investments across Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, Central Asia and South Asia. I thought leaving the IFC meant that I would not have these opportunities anymore, but have been relieved to find out that this is not the case!</p>\n\n<p>Since leaving, I have had the chance to support women entrepreneurs and leaders in Tanzania, share insights at a <a href=\"http://www.food-exhibitions.com/WorldFood-Uzbekistan\">food investment conference in Uzbekistan</a>, help US companies get partnerships in the United Arab Emirates and in Turkey, and even help foreign companies, like an Indian ICT company we helped position for entry into Central Asia. I helped a technology start-up build its presence in the Philippines. I even have a Swedish entrepreneur who is an enthusiastic client of our training programs. I love my job. </p>\n\n<p>The only thing that is missing is that I need to support more entrepreneurs building a presence in Latin America, because that is my favorite region of the world to do business in. I feel like I just confessed a secret. I am not supposed to have favorites. I do have a Mexican-American entrepreneur on our advisory board, and have just started exploring leveraging the resources that he brings to the table to support an Ecuadorian entrepreneur living in the US, who wants to build a business involving “both of his countries.” </p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about SH International? What is it? What do you enjoy about it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>SH International helps entrepreneurs build profitable multinational businesses. With access to the right expertise, deals, and relationships, entrepreneurs do not need to join the Fortune 500 before achieving profitable multinational business growth. These individuals are driven by passion and vision to build amazing global businesses outside of their current comfort zones and abilities. They do this by taking tangible steps towards achieving their goals, by attracting the resources that they need to survive and thrive, and by taking advantage of educational opportunities that fill critical gaps in their skill set. We support them in these endeavors.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy almost everything about my business. Maybe what I enjoy the most is serving others of a kindred spirit. I love meeting entrepreneurs whose hunger for life and for experiencing the world compels them, over time, to push their comfort zones out to infinite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the difference between working abroad versus working in the US?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the US, people have a very systematic way of viewing the world. There are rules that you follow, and there are systems that you go through. There are regulations and guidelines. When you start doing international work, especially in emerging markets, there is not as much structure. A lot of people from the US struggle with the level of flexibility, and so-called out-of-the-box thinking necessary to survive and thrive. It can be a lot of fun to do international work with the right mind-set. In many situations, you can create your own structure, and be very creative and innovative, a perfect situation for the entrepreneurial type!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Were you entrepreneurial during your undergrad years?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not entrepreneurial in the strict sense. I never took the entrepreneurship classes. I guess my tendency towards entrepreneurship shone through in the things that I did. For example, I was one of the five co-founders of <a href=\"http://www.upenn-pgn.org/\">Phi Gamma Nu (PGN)</a>. I think I always had a streak of liking to get things done, to create something out of nothing. I liked executing so I would say yes to opportunities to be involved in something innovative or new, but I didn't take entrepreneurship courses, and I didn't do any business competitions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any advice for college students on career paths?</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the very beginning, my mentality was that there must be only one right answer to what I should do with my life. I used to think that you can calculate the path to take, and I searched for the right answer in investment banking or consulting. Within those, you do further soul searching to pick whether you are going to be a trader or serve in other specific functions.</p>\n\n<p>I used to study a lot of math. In elementary math, there was only one right answer. Either you got it right or you did not. However, as I dove into the more advanced math, sometimes there were multiple right answers to the problem. Or sometimes, there were no solutions. So, when considering what future route to take, I try to remind myself that life decisions are just like these math equations, and try not to put so much pressure on finding the one right answer. Just because you choose one answer does not necessary mean that you are right or wrong. You just made that specific decision.</p>\n\n<div id=\"friends\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>How did you stay informed as to your opportunities along the way?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I interviewed with a lot of companies, not by choice, but because I needed to do that to get my first job. This experience gave me a lot of exposure to the type of work out there. I definitely encourage you to do a lot of interviewing, if for no other reason than the practice is helpful.</p>\n\n<p>I think at a place like Wharton, you are definitely busy. There are one million opportunities that all seem really important. You do not have the luxury to pursue every interesting opportunity, or to rigorously compare them. Following your curiosity and your strengths will allow you to naturally look at things that you are the most likely to be successful in.</p>\n\n<p>You have to understand that you can spend a million hours, months, years, beating yourself up about the career decisions that you will have to make. And you will not find that one answer, because there are multiple answers. You can better use that psychological energy to get, for example, better grades, and meet more people.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>One thing I wish is that I had met more people as an undergrad. It’s such a gift to be in Wharton undergrad. You can build many genuine, sincere relationships with amazing people.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whereas, in MBA programs, people are more intentionally there for the networking and connections. I believe that you get many more sincere friendships in undergrad. And now that I think back, all of those people are doing great things. And each of those can be a unique connection that can support you in the future, and whom you can support.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is one specific project that really stuck in your mind all these years?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of my first projects was helping an Indian information and communication technology client, called <a href=\"http://www.kdms.in/home.html\">Karvy Data Management Services</a>, position themselves to enter Central Asia.</p>\n\n<p>So there were a couple of really cool things about this project. One, the client was Adhiraj Parthasarathy, who was also one of my friends from Penn undergrad. It was just really, really fun reconnecting with a friend from college, doing a really cool project for him and with him. I think the take-away from this is that if you do the things that you are interested in at Penn, you will be surrounded by people who are likely interested in the same things, and when you leave you will have a great community to share fun opportunities with. The project itself was really fun as well. I was involved in introducing them to a lot of partners in Central Asia. From an American point of view, that was an exceptionally challenging project. </p>\n\n<p>I have learned to hold onto people who are supportive, like Adhiraj, and to find ways to further engage with them. This project was many years ago. However, we still work together. Adhiraj currently sits on the advisory board for SH International, and has helped me out with a number of strategic initiatives.</p>\n\n<div id=\"pre-reqs\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>Anything else that you want to share?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have learned a lot in the last few years working with multinational entrepreneurs. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>I came into this game thinking that experience counted a lot more than it actually does. What I found out was that the desire to take action and get things done counts a lot more.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have worked with so many entrepreneurs, all of whom have performed extraordinary feats without a ton of experience. If you allow a lack of experience to scare you, it is difficult to get much done.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

You can always [self learn](http://thesign.al/Adam-Stein/#self-learn) enough to pursue something.\n2. [Good PR](http://thesign.al/Adam-Stein/#drivers) is a great driver for early stage businesses.\n3. Careers are about the constant drive to look for opportunities: [to learn](http://thesign.al/Adam-Stein/#learn) and exercise your skills as much as possible. It is not always about scoping into your \"passion\" area.\n\n----\n\nAdam Stein graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 2005 with an MBA in Marketing. After graduation, he and co-founder Tom Arnold spent the next five years building [TerraPass](https://www.terrapass.com/) from the ground up. After a short break, they got together again and began building [Gridium](https://gridium.com/) six years ago. \n\n[TerraPass](https://www.terrapass.com/about-us/terrapass-difference) provides carbon offsetting products helping individuals and businesses reduce their climate impact. [Gridium](https://gridium.com/about/) makes software tools and platforms for modern buildings. Some of the tools include energy consumption data analytics and visualization, and maintenance tracking platforms.\n\n*Editor: TerraPass was the main topic of discussion during [one of the lectures](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1326945/files/folder/2016%20Spring%20-%20Slides%20and%20Handouts?preview=58928796) for one of my classes this semester, Product Design* [[OIDD415](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943)]*. This is the same course that I talked a lot about during [my interview with Facebook data scientist Alexandra Ressler](http://thesign.al/alexandra-ressler-data-scientist-at-facebook/). My interests in sustainability and consumer behavior motivated me to reach out and find Adam through the Penn Alumni Database, and he was surprisingly enthusiastic to share his experience. His aptitude towards recognizing opportunities and his inclination towards learning and building things allow him to bring a great perspective for anyone considering a career path in building products and entering new industries. It was also super rewarding for me to put a face and voice to what I learned from the lecture.*\n\n---\n\n<div id=\"make-transition\"></div>\n**What did you do before your MBA at Penn?**\n \nBasically, I've been working in technology for all of my post-graduate career. I actually fell into it unintentionally as I was a Biology major in Stanford. At one point, I thought I was going to go get a Ph.D. in Biology and be a research scientist. It wasn't until towards the end of my senior year that I realize I not want to pursue that path. I should have probably thought harder about it sooner. But when I did take some intro computer science courses my senior year, I ended up enjoying it. So after graduating, I got a job at school working in the Medical Informatics Department, a sort of the bridge into computing. It was a lucky time to make that transition. It was in 1996, Netscape was recently released. Everything was blowing up. Despite the fact that I was kind of under-qualified and clueless, it actually wasn't that hard to get a job. \n\n![](/content/images/2017/04/medical_info.jpg)\n\n>==This just goes to show that you can make transitions anytime.==\n\nThat's what took me to Trilogy and gave me a great experience for getting a close up view of basically what a successful startup looks like: both good and bad aspects of that. I certainly had no prior understanding of startups in general, venture, any of these things that college students are probably much more naturally tuned to these days. Even though I went to Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, it wasn't part of my undergraduate experience. It was all very new to me. So after about three years at Trilogy, I went to TellMe which was another hot startup, truly in Silicon Valley not in Texas. I also transition that point from engineering to product management, which I got a feeling was my truer passion.\n\n*Editor's Note: Based in Texas, Trilogy is an enterprise software company that automates front office functions. Adam got to work with clients such as Lucent and General Motors.*\n\n**What got you *excited* and why did you decide on an MBA?**\n \nI enjoyed aspects of engineering; but what really got me excited was trying to solve problems for people. This involved a more holistic set of skills than coding. It involves talking to users and thinking broadly about the context of what they do day-to-day. There are also elements of interface design. These kind of things that I was most enthusiastic about. So TellMe was an opportunity to transition to product management. I did that for several years and then kind of burnt out. And that's where I was just before Wharton. I actually took over a year off at that point and traveled, a lovely self-indulgent thing to do if you ever have the opportunity to do it right, I say go for it.\n\n*Editor's Note: TellMe provides advanced telecom services to Fortune 500 companies, including AT&T, FedEx, and Merrill Lynch.*\n \n**Where did you get a chance to travel?**\n \nI spent six months in South America, so probably two months backpacking in Patagonia. I worked my way up, and spent a while in Ecuador. Then, I came home, applied for an MBA program and as soon as the application process was done, I took off again and spent another roughly six months or so of riding a bicycle across Southeast Asia and China.\n\n![](/content/images/2017/04/Patagonia.jpeg)\n \n**You started your first venture in school. Could you give me a quick summary as to what you think Terrapass was when it first started?**\n\n*Editor's Note: Adam's first venture emerged straight from the Product Design [[OIDD415]](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943) class. Professor Ulrich spent the majority of one semester bragging about Terrapass.*\n\n![](/content/images/2017/04/terrapass.png)\n \nSo Karl's class has changed over the years, and ours was the very first version of it. In this version, Karl came up with the basic idea. So that doesn't mean he designed the product or the go-to-market strategy or all of the other things that we have to do. The core of it was carbon offsets for consumers and that was handed to us. So that was the idea, we did stick with the idea, we didn't throw it out and start all over again. We did have to figure out what the product was going to look like, etc. We spent nine weeks or so figuring that out. I was on the marketing side, but it was a lot of fun. It was a timely idea. There was some unwarranted optimism at the time. There was going to be action taken on climate change. But unfortunately, climate change was a very boring thing for journalists. But we had a nice hook. They liked to write about us because it was a more consumer-oriented angle that was easy to write a cute story about.\n \nWe very quickly found ourselves getting pretty amazing press coverage very disproportion to our size and maturity. That was a great driver of the company.\n \n<div id=\"self-learn\"></div>\n**Were there any additional classes or resources on campus that really helped you?**\n \nNo, I don't think we rely very heavily on other resources. I can imagine doing so if the product itself was more complex, but there wasn't a lot of you know physical design. There wasn't a lot of complicated technology either. Some of the complexity was around sourcing the product. It's quite complicated: understanding the carbon markets. But that was not knowledge that really existed anywhere on campus. It's not like Penn had a department in carbon markets. So that was something we had to develop in-house. It was a fun and intellectually engaging project: carbon markets were new. They combined environmental goals, economic theory and policy in a way that if you happen to be interested in those kinds of topics were lot of fun. So you really just self-taught. I ended up actually doing quite a bit of writing about our markets for general public. That became part of my job description at Terrapass. This was before content management was really a thing. But I guess it was an early form of content management was helping to translate some of these concepts to the general public.\n\n**Was there a defining moment that you realized that your idea really had potential?**\n \nIt got increasingly interesting after graduation. At that point, it was a very small thing and it was not clear that it could ever be more than a very niche product which arguably is what it actually became. But it was growing in a manner that suggested that there might actually be business there. So no I don't think there was a eureka moment. I think there was steady progress.\n \n**Can you talk a bit about the highlights and lowlights of the entire process of Terrapass? What was the partnership process like?**\n \nWe did end up landing some big partnerships that really drove growth, certainly the most meaningful one was the partnership with Expedia.\n \n**How was that done?**\n \n>==It fell into our laps.==\n\nThey called. I remember picking up the phone one day and it was them. They were interested in potentially bundling us with airline ticket sales and that came together very quickly. It was successful beyond anything we had imagined. There was the traffic was so disproportionate to anything we've ever seen before and it was a very successful program.\n \nThere was also another sort of interesting highlight that quickly became the lowlight was when we were, we became the gift bag for the Academy Awards one year. It was 2006 maybe and they got involved in some controversy because they were giving away overly expensive gift bags to these very wealthy celebrities. And there was some sort of tax implications that they were not properly dealing with and people thought it was somewhat unseemly to shower these wealthy people with high end luxury items. So they decided to do this environmental gestures, which was kind of a fun bizarre project to work on. But also painted a huge bulls-eye from a press standpoint that kicked off some backlash that went into a very critical and also incredibly poorly researched articles that became a big PR disaster for us. So it was a very interesting experience certainly all around, highlight and lowlight.\n \n**How did you manage to sell such a premium good to consumers? Was it difficult changing consumer behavior?**\n \nAt the end of the day, it was a niche product. We never grow the category to the point where Terrapass was going to be a large business. It appeals to a small self-selected group of people who are engaged on this particular issue. We did a good job of reaching as many of those but it wasn't a large market.\n \n<div id=\"drivers\"></div>\n**What drove Terrapass?**\n \nCertainly early on, it was primarily driven by PR. So that's a nice when you are PR worthy but it doesn't apply in many cases to a lot of companies. Some companies are more masterful than others at generating their own PR. We were early in content marketing. We basically wrote a lot of stuff and syndicated all over the place. We were somewhat geeky policy nerd types and we spent a lot of time getting pretty deep in the woods on these topics and we enjoyed it.\n \n**How did you guys deal with environmental regulations?**\n \nThis is a complex area because at the time, when we started there were no regulated carbon markets, if I'm remembering correctly. There was only the voluntary markets, but there was clearly a lot of activity around this issue and the thought was that there would soon be regulated carbon markets, hopefully a national one. Certainly there was regular ones in Europe. So the thought was that this would actually happened in America. We ended up seeing was sort of a patchwork of regional ones and we pay a lot of attention because there was this opportunity and risk. We were sort of amassing our own portfolio of these things. And the concern was that their value could basically be really wiped away if the regulations broke in a way that's sort of rendered useless. And certainly there was a lot of private companies who were starting to participate on the voluntary markets on the theory that these things would not be worthless. But this is a lot of kind of reading the tea leaves and paying attention to draft legislation and paying attention to these markets and just trying to stay ahead. But it looks like things might be moving. As it turns out they kind of move nowhere, I mean the national market never came to be. And I actually am just disconnected enough down from this world that I don't know the latest state of the various regional markets are.\n \nCertainly, the price never got very high because of the natural gas boom. The caps that were being set were too loose. So there was a lot of slack in the markets. This is probably an overly technical answer to your question. Basically it was a very complex regulatory landscape. And if there's anything I learned at Terrapass, it was to try to avoid that situation.\n\n**Did you end up recruiting for a lot of things that MBA students normally recruit for?**\n \nNo I didn't apply for any jobs. \n\n>==For that recruiting week, I went to Baja Mexico and looked at whales.==\n\nIt was probably not the most well considered way to approach my job hunt. But I was not interested in sort of consulting or finance track, so I kind of winged it.\n \n**Why is that? What about consulting and finance that didn't attract you?**\n \nFinance, looking at it, I wasn't qualified. If it were my dream to go into finance, I could have made that transition at Wharton. But that was not my goal. Consulting, I certainly could jump into. That seemed like a step in the direction away from what I was trying to do, which was find work that really engaged me. Not that I think consulting is necessarily inherently terrible. It seemed like long hours working on project that was probably just work. It wasn't what I was looking for.\n \n**Can you talk a bit more about what your MBA meant to you?**\n \nWell the truth is I actually went in looking for a career change. I was interested in development economics and went to do an MBA program because I was advised to. It's a terminal degree you get it after two years. It offers a lot of flexibility after that and rather than going to graduate school. That made sense to me, but obviously did not end up going into development economics. I did discover that I enjoy technology, which I do like and enjoy, and there were opportunities to address causes that I cared about, while retaining the flexibility and speed of a startup culture which I generally enjoy.\n \n**Could you talk a bit about your relationship with your co-founder Tom? How did you meet him and why did you decide to work with him?**\n \nWe knew each other socially at Wharton. And then we also took this class together. Tom was on the sale side for the class. He was very passionate about the project, and I think he had a lot of natural leadership abilities. He's the one who became the chief, while we were still in school for the next quarter. Mostly, he pushed it forward. There was a time where it was a one-man show. There was not really enough of anything to sustain much in the way of operations. When things got more stable, I came back in. I mean we worked well together. We have a very similar set of priorities. And a common view sort of how to build a great company. And at the same time we have a complementing set of operational skills: whereas Tom is very sales and finance driven, and I am very product driven. It's a good partnership because we tend not to conflict on big picture stuff and made meaningful contributions in different areas.\n \n**What are you guys working on now?**\n\n\n \nSo the story now actually grew very directly over our experience at Terrapass. We both wanted to get closer to the energy saving side of thing.\n \nCarbon offsets are a financial mechanism and we want to actually get closer the projects themselves. We're both interested in buildings. Buildings use about 40 percent of the world's energy. A lot of the attention goes to transportation. Transportation is certainly sexy. \n\n>==Buildings are from the technology standpoint decidedly unsexy. They're pretty old school. They are two tubes of pipes and ducts.==\n\nAnd they tend to hang around for decades or even hundreds of years and they're just not on the bleeding edge. And so it seemed like there was an opportunity there. So we were both having thoughts along these lines, without even really having to discuss with one another.\n \n**What does Gridium do?**\n \n*Editor's Note: After Adam and Tom left Terrapass in 2009, they both went separate ways before coming back together in 2013 to found Gridium.*\n\n![](/content/images/2017/04/how_it_works_08.jpg)\n\nWe do energy data analytics. We take data from smart meters, new digital upgrade from the old analog meters. That became actionable information for property managers so they can understand and reduce their energy use. Smart meters are fairly new on the scene but basically instead of getting 12 energy data points a year in the form of your monthly bill, people now get 35,000 per year, because smart meters takes reading every 15 minutes. That's both wonderful and also overwhelming to your typical property manager and we saw an opportunity to take a software based approach to energy efficiency. One of the big hurdles of energy efficiency is usually there's an upfront cost and then there's a payback over several years. Even if the payback is there, it is often hard for building operators to bear those upfront costs. We were excited about the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, which when we started Gridium wasn't new but definitely wasn't as dominant as it is now. We saw the possibility of bringing no upfront costs, low ongoing-fee service model to energy efficiency and that's what we did.\n \n**Can you describe a typical day for you at the office?**\n \nIt's a little different for me. I spend most of my time with engineering team. Even though I'm not an engineer and I don't officially manage them. We have a development lead that is the team with whom I had sort of sitting down day-to-day working together with them on build our product. What I do on a given day, depends a little bit of where we are in our product lifecycle, but we are now releasing all the time. So I'm also doing a little bit of everything. I will be doing product specifications where I'm working with a designer to basically spec out how the product would behave or what the product would look like. I do bunch of customer interviews, where I work with existing users or colleagues to figure out what's working well for them, what's not. I am doing the testing. Certainly, life in a small software startup, mean we don't have a lot of dedicated Quality Assurance resources so often I'm the guy looking at what's being built and making sure it's actually behaving the way that it's supposed to, both in terms of finding bugs and also is it meeting our user requirements. I do a lot of everything else because I'm a founder is therefore I do a lot HR stuff and I chime in on deal strategy and try to figure out, huddle with Tom to make sure we we're not speeding down on our runway too quickly.\n \n<div id=\"learn\"></div>\n**Any more advice you would give undergraduate or graduates right now?**\n \nThere's probably a lot of focus on finding a passion when you're on the ground. For most people, that's probably not the most productive framework for thinking about your career. A lot of us aren't so lucky to necessarily work in a passion field but it's also a reflective understanding of what makes for a good job.\n \n>==Essentially all your career you're going to be wanting to look for opportunities to learn as much as possible and the opportunities to exercise skills.==\n\nI worry about that sort of thing much more than the exact area in which I applied myself. Not that it's irrelevant or unimportant. In my career, I made a very explicit attempt to seek out areas to focus on that I found meaningful. That being say, there's probably a lot of different areas that I could have ended up. There's sort of happenstance involved, my path is pretty obvious to me. Karl assigned us a projects and that's how I ended up really determining much of the course of my post-graduate career. That's dumb luck. So it's more important to figure out what sort of skills you most enjoy exercising and giving yourself a good opportunity to learn from good people and connect with good people around that especially early on.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

After graduation, he and co-founder Tom Arnold spent the next five years building <a href=\"https://www.terrapass.com/\">TerraPass</a> from the ground up. After a short break, they got together again and began building <a href=\"https://gridium.com/\">Gridium</a> six years ago. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.terrapass.com/about-us/terrapass-difference\">TerraPass</a> provides carbon offsetting products helping individuals and businesses reduce their climate impact. <a href=\"https://gridium.com/about/\">Gridium</a> makes software tools and platforms for modern buildings. Some of the tools include energy consumption data analytics and visualization, and maintenance tracking platforms.</p>\n\n<p><em>Editor: TerraPass was the main topic of discussion during <a href=\"https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1326945/files/folder/2016%20Spring%20-%20Slides%20and%20Handouts?preview=58928796\">one of the lectures</a> for one of my classes this semester, Product Design</em> [<a href=\"https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943\">OIDD415</a>]<em>. This is the same course that I talked a lot about during <a href=\"http://thesign.al/alexandra-ressler-data-scientist-at-facebook/\">my interview with Facebook data scientist Alexandra Ressler</a>. My interests in sustainability and consumer behavior motivated me to reach out and find Adam through the Penn Alumni Database, and he was surprisingly enthusiastic to share his experience. His aptitude towards recognizing opportunities and his inclination towards learning and building things allow him to bring a great perspective for anyone considering a career path in building products and entering new industries. It was also super rewarding for me to put a face and voice to what I learned from the lecture.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div id=\"make-transition\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>What did you do before your MBA at Penn?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Basically, I've been working in technology for all of my post-graduate career. I actually fell into it unintentionally as I was a Biology major in Stanford. At one point, I thought I was going to go get a Ph.D. in Biology and be a research scientist. It wasn't until towards the end of my senior year that I realize I not want to pursue that path. I should have probably thought harder about it sooner. But when I did take some intro computer science courses my senior year, I ended up enjoying it. So after graduating, I got a job at school working in the Medical Informatics Department, a sort of the bridge into computing. It was a lucky time to make that transition. It was in 1996, Netscape was recently released. Everything was blowing up. Despite the fact that I was kind of under-qualified and clueless, it actually wasn't that hard to get a job. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/medical_info.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>This just goes to show that you can make transitions anytime.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's what took me to Trilogy and gave me a great experience for getting a close up view of basically what a successful startup looks like: both good and bad aspects of that. I certainly had no prior understanding of startups in general, venture, any of these things that college students are probably much more naturally tuned to these days. Even though I went to Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, it wasn't part of my undergraduate experience. It was all very new to me. So after about three years at Trilogy, I went to TellMe which was another hot startup, truly in Silicon Valley not in Texas. I also transition that point from engineering to product management, which I got a feeling was my truer passion.</p>\n\n<p><em>Editor's Note: Based in Texas, Trilogy is an enterprise software company that automates front office functions. Adam got to work with clients such as Lucent and General Motors.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>What got you <em>excited</em> and why did you decide on an MBA?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed aspects of engineering; but what really got me excited was trying to solve problems for people. This involved a more holistic set of skills than coding. It involves talking to users and thinking broadly about the context of what they do day-to-day. There are also elements of interface design. These kind of things that I was most enthusiastic about. So TellMe was an opportunity to transition to product management. I did that for several years and then kind of burnt out. And that's where I was just before Wharton. I actually took over a year off at that point and traveled, a lovely self-indulgent thing to do if you ever have the opportunity to do it right, I say go for it.</p>\n\n<p><em>Editor's Note: TellMe provides advanced telecom services to Fortune 500 companies, including AT&amp;T, FedEx, and Merrill Lynch.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did you get a chance to travel?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I spent six months in South America, so probably two months backpacking in Patagonia. I worked my way up, and spent a while in Ecuador. Then, I came home, applied for an MBA program and as soon as the application process was done, I took off again and spent another roughly six months or so of riding a bicycle across Southeast Asia and China.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/Patagonia.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>You started your first venture in school. Could you give me a quick summary as to what you think Terrapass was when it first started?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Editor's Note: Adam's first venture emerged straight from the Product Design <a href=\"https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943\">[OIDD415]</a> class. Professor Ulrich spent the majority of one semester bragging about Terrapass.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/terrapass.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>So Karl's class has changed over the years, and ours was the very first version of it. In this version, Karl came up with the basic idea. So that doesn't mean he designed the product or the go-to-market strategy or all of the other things that we have to do. The core of it was carbon offsets for consumers and that was handed to us. So that was the idea, we did stick with the idea, we didn't throw it out and start all over again. We did have to figure out what the product was going to look like, etc. We spent nine weeks or so figuring that out. I was on the marketing side, but it was a lot of fun. It was a timely idea. There was some unwarranted optimism at the time. There was going to be action taken on climate change. But unfortunately, climate change was a very boring thing for journalists. But we had a nice hook. They liked to write about us because it was a more consumer-oriented angle that was easy to write a cute story about.</p>\n\n<p>We very quickly found ourselves getting pretty amazing press coverage very disproportion to our size and maturity. That was a great driver of the company.</p>\n\n<div id=\"self-learn\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>Were there any additional classes or resources on campus that really helped you?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, I don't think we rely very heavily on other resources. I can imagine doing so if the product itself was more complex, but there wasn't a lot of you know physical design. There wasn't a lot of complicated technology either. Some of the complexity was around sourcing the product. It's quite complicated: understanding the carbon markets. But that was not knowledge that really existed anywhere on campus. It's not like Penn had a department in carbon markets. So that was something we had to develop in-house. It was a fun and intellectually engaging project: carbon markets were new. They combined environmental goals, economic theory and policy in a way that if you happen to be interested in those kinds of topics were lot of fun. So you really just self-taught. I ended up actually doing quite a bit of writing about our markets for general public. That became part of my job description at Terrapass. This was before content management was really a thing. But I guess it was an early form of content management was helping to translate some of these concepts to the general public.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Was there a defining moment that you realized that your idea really had potential?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It got increasingly interesting after graduation. At that point, it was a very small thing and it was not clear that it could ever be more than a very niche product which arguably is what it actually became. But it was growing in a manner that suggested that there might actually be business there. So no I don't think there was a eureka moment. I think there was steady progress.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the highlights and lowlights of the entire process of Terrapass? What was the partnership process like?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We did end up landing some big partnerships that really drove growth, certainly the most meaningful one was the partnership with Expedia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How was that done?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>It fell into our laps.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They called. I remember picking up the phone one day and it was them. They were interested in potentially bundling us with airline ticket sales and that came together very quickly. It was successful beyond anything we had imagined. There was the traffic was so disproportionate to anything we've ever seen before and it was a very successful program.</p>\n\n<p>There was also another sort of interesting highlight that quickly became the lowlight was when we were, we became the gift bag for the Academy Awards one year. It was 2006 maybe and they got involved in some controversy because they were giving away overly expensive gift bags to these very wealthy celebrities. And there was some sort of tax implications that they were not properly dealing with and people thought it was somewhat unseemly to shower these wealthy people with high end luxury items. So they decided to do this environmental gestures, which was kind of a fun bizarre project to work on. But also painted a huge bulls-eye from a press standpoint that kicked off some backlash that went into a very critical and also incredibly poorly researched articles that became a big PR disaster for us. So it was a very interesting experience certainly all around, highlight and lowlight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you manage to sell such a premium good to consumers? Was it difficult changing consumer behavior?</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, it was a niche product. We never grow the category to the point where Terrapass was going to be a large business. It appeals to a small self-selected group of people who are engaged on this particular issue. We did a good job of reaching as many of those but it wasn't a large market.</p>\n\n<div id=\"drivers\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>What drove Terrapass?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Certainly early on, it was primarily driven by PR. So that's a nice when you are PR worthy but it doesn't apply in many cases to a lot of companies. Some companies are more masterful than others at generating their own PR. We were early in content marketing. We basically wrote a lot of stuff and syndicated all over the place. We were somewhat geeky policy nerd types and we spent a lot of time getting pretty deep in the woods on these topics and we enjoyed it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you guys deal with environmental regulations?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a complex area because at the time, when we started there were no regulated carbon markets, if I'm remembering correctly. There was only the voluntary markets, but there was clearly a lot of activity around this issue and the thought was that there would soon be regulated carbon markets, hopefully a national one. Certainly there was regular ones in Europe. So the thought was that this would actually happened in America. We ended up seeing was sort of a patchwork of regional ones and we pay a lot of attention because there was this opportunity and risk. We were sort of amassing our own portfolio of these things. And the concern was that their value could basically be really wiped away if the regulations broke in a way that's sort of rendered useless. And certainly there was a lot of private companies who were starting to participate on the voluntary markets on the theory that these things would not be worthless. But this is a lot of kind of reading the tea leaves and paying attention to draft legislation and paying attention to these markets and just trying to stay ahead. But it looks like things might be moving. As it turns out they kind of move nowhere, I mean the national market never came to be. And I actually am just disconnected enough down from this world that I don't know the latest state of the various regional markets are.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, the price never got very high because of the natural gas boom. The caps that were being set were too loose. So there was a lot of slack in the markets. This is probably an overly technical answer to your question. Basically it was a very complex regulatory landscape. And if there's anything I learned at Terrapass, it was to try to avoid that situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you end up recruiting for a lot of things that MBA students normally recruit for?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No I didn't apply for any jobs. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>For that recruiting week, I went to Baja Mexico and looked at whales.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was probably not the most well considered way to approach my job hunt. But I was not interested in sort of consulting or finance track, so I kind of winged it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is that? What about consulting and finance that didn't attract you?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finance, looking at it, I wasn't qualified. If it were my dream to go into finance, I could have made that transition at Wharton. But that was not my goal. Consulting, I certainly could jump into. That seemed like a step in the direction away from what I was trying to do, which was find work that really engaged me. Not that I think consulting is necessarily inherently terrible. It seemed like long hours working on project that was probably just work. It wasn't what I was looking for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you talk a bit more about what your MBA meant to you?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well the truth is I actually went in looking for a career change. I was interested in development economics and went to do an MBA program because I was advised to. It's a terminal degree you get it after two years. It offers a lot of flexibility after that and rather than going to graduate school. That made sense to me, but obviously did not end up going into development economics. I did discover that I enjoy technology, which I do like and enjoy, and there were opportunities to address causes that I cared about, while retaining the flexibility and speed of a startup culture which I generally enjoy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Could you talk a bit about your relationship with your co-founder Tom? How did you meet him and why did you decide to work with him?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We knew each other socially at Wharton. And then we also took this class together. Tom was on the sale side for the class. He was very passionate about the project, and I think he had a lot of natural leadership abilities. He's the one who became the chief, while we were still in school for the next quarter. Mostly, he pushed it forward. There was a time where it was a one-man show. There was not really enough of anything to sustain much in the way of operations. When things got more stable, I came back in. I mean we worked well together. We have a very similar set of priorities. And a common view sort of how to build a great company. And at the same time we have a complementing set of operational skills: whereas Tom is very sales and finance driven, and I am very product driven. It's a good partnership because we tend not to conflict on big picture stuff and made meaningful contributions in different areas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are you guys working on now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So the story now actually grew very directly over our experience at Terrapass. We both wanted to get closer to the energy saving side of thing.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon offsets are a financial mechanism and we want to actually get closer the projects themselves. We're both interested in buildings. Buildings use about 40 percent of the world's energy. A lot of the attention goes to transportation. Transportation is certainly sexy. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>Buildings are from the technology standpoint decidedly unsexy. They're pretty old school. They are two tubes of pipes and ducts.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And they tend to hang around for decades or even hundreds of years and they're just not on the bleeding edge. And so it seemed like there was an opportunity there. So we were both having thoughts along these lines, without even really having to discuss with one another.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does Gridium do?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Editor's Note: After Adam and Tom left Terrapass in 2009, they both went separate ways before coming back together in 2013 to found Gridium.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/how_it_works_08.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>We do energy data analytics. We take data from smart meters, new digital upgrade from the old analog meters. That became actionable information for property managers so they can understand and reduce their energy use. Smart meters are fairly new on the scene but basically instead of getting 12 energy data points a year in the form of your monthly bill, people now get 35,000 per year, because smart meters takes reading every 15 minutes. That's both wonderful and also overwhelming to your typical property manager and we saw an opportunity to take a software based approach to energy efficiency. One of the big hurdles of energy efficiency is usually there's an upfront cost and then there's a payback over several years. Even if the payback is there, it is often hard for building operators to bear those upfront costs. We were excited about the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, which when we started Gridium wasn't new but definitely wasn't as dominant as it is now. We saw the possibility of bringing no upfront costs, low ongoing-fee service model to energy efficiency and that's what we did.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you describe a typical day for you at the office?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's a little different for me. I spend most of my time with engineering team. Even though I'm not an engineer and I don't officially manage them. We have a development lead that is the team with whom I had sort of sitting down day-to-day working together with them on build our product. What I do on a given day, depends a little bit of where we are in our product lifecycle, but we are now releasing all the time. So I'm also doing a little bit of everything. I will be doing product specifications where I'm working with a designer to basically spec out how the product would behave or what the product would look like. I do bunch of customer interviews, where I work with existing users or colleagues to figure out what's working well for them, what's not. I am doing the testing. Certainly, life in a small software startup, mean we don't have a lot of dedicated Quality Assurance resources so often I'm the guy looking at what's being built and making sure it's actually behaving the way that it's supposed to, both in terms of finding bugs and also is it meeting our user requirements. I do a lot of everything else because I'm a founder is therefore I do a lot HR stuff and I chime in on deal strategy and try to figure out, huddle with Tom to make sure we we're not speeding down on our runway too quickly.</p>\n\n<div id=\"learn\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>Any more advice you would give undergraduate or graduates right now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's probably a lot of focus on finding a passion when you're on the ground. For most people, that's probably not the most productive framework for thinking about your career. A lot of us aren't so lucky to necessarily work in a passion field but it's also a reflective understanding of what makes for a good job.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>Essentially all your career you're going to be wanting to look for opportunities to learn as much as possible and the opportunities to exercise skills.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I worry about that sort of thing much more than the exact area in which I applied myself. Not that it's irrelevant or unimportant. In my career, I made a very explicit attempt to seek out areas to focus on that I found meaningful. That being say, there's probably a lot of different areas that I could have ended up. There's sort of happenstance involved, my path is pretty obvious to me. Karl assigned us a projects and that's how I ended up really determining much of the course of my post-graduate career. That's dumb luck. So it's more important to figure out what sort of skills you most enjoy exercising and giving yourself a good opportunity to learn from good people and connect with good people around that especially early on.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

Confidence comes as much from <a style=\"color:blue\" href=\"#repeated\">repeated failures</a> as from repeated successes.\n3. To be happier, people should wake up in the morning <a style=\"color:blue\" href=\"#happy\">feeling passionate</a> about what they are going to do.\n\n---\n\nSlava Rubin finished his undergraduate degree at University of Pennsylvania in 2000. After a few years in consulting, Slava took the leap of faith into entrepreneurship. In 2008, Slava founded [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/) and since has been putting his 100 percent into growing the international crowdfunding website. To date, the platform has attracted more than **$800M** investment for creative, entrepreneurial and cause-related projects launched on the site. \n\n*Editor: In mid-February, [The Sign.al](http://thesign.al/our-team/) attended an open talk with Slava and Penn's Engineering Dean Vijay Kumar at the [Pennovation Center](https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/). After an engaging hour of discussion and hearing about Slava's hurdles and challenges throughout his career, we could not pass off the chance to interview him ourselves.*\n\n---\n\n**What were you like in college?** \n\nI tried to have a really well-rounded experience. I was a Wharton undergrad — finance, entrepreneurial management double major. I was a Management 100 TA. I also played football as a freshman and then rugby all four years. I was in a social fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, as a sophomore, and I also helped found a business fraternity chapter at Penn: [AKPsi](http://upennakpsi.org/). I liked hanging out with friends, and I was one of those people who tried to experience a lot of stuff at college. \n\n**Being that well rounded, when did you decide to take a leap of faith and really dedicate yourself to one thing or did you really enjoy the well-rounded education that you got?**\n\nI was much more into well-roundedness, and having that diverse set of friends and doing lots of different things. I tried not to be too focused on any one thing while I was in college. \n\n**How did you balance time and your commitments?** \n\nI just kept myself really busy. I wasn't one to spend a lot of time at home in my dorm room. I wasn't one to take lots of nap. I really love the experience of interacting with people going to events. I loved all the socializing and going to all the incredible experiences that happen in college. Plus, being a part of all these communities, whether the professional fraternity, the social fraternity, being a Management 100 TA, or various sports really exposed me to a lot of fun activities. \n\n<div id=\"stress\"></div>\n**What do you think of college students these days and their approach to either having a well-rounded education or being very focused in a particular area?** \n\nI think that college is difficult, especially at Wharton, and it could easily be highly stressful. \n\n>==Too often I see young people that stress themselves out too much at too young of an age. It is important to do well in school and get good grades. It's really important to have a well-rounded experience. ==\n\n**Now on career type stuff — what did you want to do when you got to Wharton?** \n\nI thought I was going to become an investment banker. That's why I applied and got into Wharton. As I started to actually take classes, I decided that I did not want to become an investment banker. I really didn't decide what exactly I wanted to do but I started to sense that I really felt entrepreneurial. \n\n\n>==I like identifying new problems in a world that need solutions. And I just felt like entrepreneurship was the path that I wanted to navigate. ==\n\n**Looks like it worked out because you ended up becoming an entrepreneur! What did you think about the Wharton entrepreneurial education overall?** \n\nWharton, like many schools, provides a very good curriculum. Being entrepreneurial is much more hands-on, so I can't say much about your classes since I was ready to jump them and become an entrepreneur. Hearing the stories [of entrepreneurial ventures], meeting the entrepreneurs, and learning about the experiences were super valuable as I continued to forward my career, and overall was just very inspirational. \n\n**Were there any specific resources that you used over here that you thought were really useful for entrepreneurs. And if not, what do you think Wharton can definitely do better on in their education and resources for entrepreneurs?** \n\nBeing a Management 100 TA was helpful because some of the things that I learned were teamwork, leadership, communication, which I think was helpful for entrepreneurship. Coming up with a project that we had to figure out how to run. \n\nBeyond that, I took a few entrepreneurial classes — like Ed Shil's class really awesome. He would bring in these super experienced entrepreneurs that would share their stories and you get ask them how they navigate it all. (*Editor's note: Ed Shil is no longer teaching this. [MGMT265: Culture of Technology](https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/index.cfm?gridterm=2016C&gridcourse=MGMT265&griddept=MGMT), taught by Vice Dean Rosenkopf is very similar and currently offered.*) \n\nAlso, an OPIM class back in the day was a mixed Wharton and Engineering class where you would come up with a startup and pitch it to VCs at the end of the class (Editor's note: This course is now [EAS445/545: Engineering Entrepreneurship](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/entrepreneurship/eas445-545.php)). These sort of hands-on courses include having to navigate ideas and build up business plans, create mockups or the original web site, what the plans would be, marketing plan, logo, and what the target markets would be. \n\n<div id=\"repeated\"></div>\n**So pertaining to this very hands-on approach to entrepreneurship, if you were designing an entrepreneurial curriculum for your kids is that the approach you would take?** \n\nYeah, if I tried to teach entrepreneurship. I would actually start in seventh grade and do a ten-year program, through high school and college. It would have a dashboard that would track you along the way to see what you're doing well at and what you still need to improve on. And each year, I would do three sections in my class starting in seventh grade. So the first section will be the theory where you learn the material. The second would be your hands-on having to start a company and bring it to market part. And the third section would be learning and reviewing everything: what happened and what went well, what didn't go well, what you can improve on. And I'll do it for ten years in a row so you get practice at bringing the idea to market and the process of probably failing a lot, and learning a lot from this failure.\n\n**You said in another interview, one of the best things you can do for the world is to empower entrepreneurs. Where do colleges and universities fit into that in the future?** \n\nColleges and universities need to provide the education that is helpful for students to get careers and improve the world, whether that is pre-law, writing, finance or pre-med. I do think that being inspired to become an entrepreneur is super valuable. \n\n>==We all think of our entrepreneurs as having very little education, very little practice, that they just jump off a cliff and start companies — taking all the risk in the world. If we strive to provide more guidance to inspire entrepreneurs, we would be in a better place. ==\n\n**How do you have the creative confidence to take that kind of leap of faith, to jump off this cliff to start your companies?** \n\nI grew up with immigrant parents. We came over from Belarus, so I've seen them work hard and figure out solutions in places where there are massive unknowns. I got inspiration from my parents. I've been raised where anything is possible and that's where the confidence comes from. That doesn't mean that it's easy to have that confidence. Part of that confidence comes from the struggle that comes along when my dad died when I was a kid, and having to figure out life after that. I don't think that everybody needs to go through the same experiences that I have. Some of that can be taught in academic environments and definitely through do a hands-on experiential environment. \n\n**Do you remember what you did each summer at Penn?** \n\nI did not have a plan, so it was very organic. Between my junior and senior year was the summer that I interned for Cisco Systems, the internet networking company. I interned in Brussels, in Belgium. I did that because I studied abroad and decided to stay in Europe. Between my sophomore and junior year, I interned for West Capital Management, which is an investment management firm that is still around. When I joined them, it was actually only one person, Matthew West. Now, it's dozens of people. I got to see and experience a one-man firm that was really entrepreneurial in management evolve. Between my freshman and sophomore, I just went home.\n\n**I want to jump now into more of your story. I think it's really inspirational hearing how you went from getting rejected from 50 plus investors for Indiegogo all the way to running this huge crowd funding site now. When Indiegogo was just getting started, if you had pitched me this idea as a crowd funder I would have thought, \"You want me to just throw my money at something on a screen that I've no idea what it's about?\" How did you go about getting your first adopters for this?**\n\nIt's the classic marketplace challenge. So on the supply side it's the offering company, and on the demand side is the backers and it's a tricky chicken-egg situation trying to keep both sides balanced. We went for the private companies first that tried to used their network to tap into original funding and then tried to use the connections that we got from each of the offering companies where we start getting 10, 50, 100 backers for companies that then created a network of backers for future companies we posted on the site. \n\n**How long did it take you to saturate the supply side of products?**\n\nSaturated is a major term, so I would say that we are not even saturated now. It definitely took some time to start creating the marketplace effect. A marketplace is one of those things that you can't have it happen overnight. You really do need some time for it to reach liquidity. I would say it took 18 months to have some continuous growth. \n\n**During your presentation at Penn, you said, \"If you want to change the finance industry, you can't do it in the finance industry\". What are some other industries right now that can be changed from the outside? Can you elaborate on that mindset?**\n\nHighly regulated industries are very hard to change from the inside because the regulation is set up in a way to have the king stay king, and others won't be able to disrupt them. So anywhere in which there is a lot of regulation will be hard to disrupt the industry. \n\n**So as disruptor and kind of a rebel, how do you stay that rebel against the industry and the regulators but also stay congenial enough to get the final result? You were instrumental in the drafting of the JOBS Act (*Editor's note: JOBS act was signed by President Obama in 2012 for new SEC rules on capital formation, including the use of capital in crowd-funding projects*). How do you manage those kinds of relationship dynamics?**\n\nThe important thing is to focus on the customer and the products and create something that people want to use. And if you're able stay outside the lens of regulation, then that's great! As you continue to grow, there's a good chance that the regulated industry will interact with you, and you will have to set the dynamic of engagement. \n\n<div id=\"happy\"></div>\n**What do you think is a fatal mistake that you see a lot of young people making in the context of planning careers and approaching education?** \n\nPeople need to be happy. Whether you take a finance job or an entrepreneurial job, or you become a doctor, work is something that you probably spend a lot of time doing. Being able to wake up in the morning feeling passionate and happy about what you're doing all day — now that's a gift. The opposite is you really hate it or you're just doing it for the money or killing time. \n\n>==You're really missing out on what incredible things you can accomplish by having the passion behind you as you move forward with your career. ==\n\n**Do you have any specific book or movie recommendations?** \n\n[12 Angry Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/): The reason is that it shows the power of an individual to believe in his/her passion to improve the world. \n\n[Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/): The reason is that it's non-linear.

After a few years in consulting, Slava took the leap of faith into entrepreneurship. In 2008, Slava founded <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/\">Indiegogo</a> and since has been putting his 100 percent into growing the international crowdfunding website. To date, the platform has attracted more than <strong>$800M</strong> investment for creative, entrepreneurial and cause-related projects launched on the site. </p>\n\n<p><em>Editor: In mid-February, <a href=\"http://thesign.al/our-team/\">The Sign.al</a> attended an open talk with Slava and Penn's Engineering Dean Vijay Kumar at the <a href=\"https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/\">Pennovation Center</a>. After an engaging hour of discussion and hearing about Slava's hurdles and challenges throughout his career, we could not pass off the chance to interview him ourselves.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>What were you like in college?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I tried to have a really well-rounded experience. I was a Wharton undergrad — finance, entrepreneurial management double major. I was a Management 100 TA. I also played football as a freshman and then rugby all four years. I was in a social fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, as a sophomore, and I also helped found a business fraternity chapter at Penn: <a href=\"http://upennakpsi.org/\">AKPsi</a>. I liked hanging out with friends, and I was one of those people who tried to experience a lot of stuff at college. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Being that well rounded, when did you decide to take a leap of faith and really dedicate yourself to one thing or did you really enjoy the well-rounded education that you got?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was much more into well-roundedness, and having that diverse set of friends and doing lots of different things. I tried not to be too focused on any one thing while I was in college. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you balance time and your commitments?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I just kept myself really busy. I wasn't one to spend a lot of time at home in my dorm room. I wasn't one to take lots of nap. I really love the experience of interacting with people going to events. I loved all the socializing and going to all the incredible experiences that happen in college. Plus, being a part of all these communities, whether the professional fraternity, the social fraternity, being a Management 100 TA, or various sports really exposed me to a lot of fun activities. </p>\n\n<div id=\"stress\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>What do you think of college students these days and their approach to either having a well-rounded education or being very focused in a particular area?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I think that college is difficult, especially at Wharton, and it could easily be highly stressful. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>Too often I see young people that stress themselves out too much at too young of an age. It is important to do well in school and get good grades. It's really important to have a well-rounded experience. </mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Now on career type stuff — what did you want to do when you got to Wharton?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I thought I was going to become an investment banker. That's why I applied and got into Wharton. As I started to actually take classes, I decided that I did not want to become an investment banker. I really didn't decide what exactly I wanted to do but I started to sense that I really felt entrepreneurial. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>I like identifying new problems in a world that need solutions. And I just felt like entrepreneurship was the path that I wanted to navigate. </mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Looks like it worked out because you ended up becoming an entrepreneur! What did you think about the Wharton entrepreneurial education overall?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Wharton, like many schools, provides a very good curriculum. Being entrepreneurial is much more hands-on, so I can't say much about your classes since I was ready to jump them and become an entrepreneur. Hearing the stories [of entrepreneurial ventures], meeting the entrepreneurs, and learning about the experiences were super valuable as I continued to forward my career, and overall was just very inspirational. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Were there any specific resources that you used over here that you thought were really useful for entrepreneurs. And if not, what do you think Wharton can definitely do better on in their education and resources for entrepreneurs?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Being a Management 100 TA was helpful because some of the things that I learned were teamwork, leadership, communication, which I think was helpful for entrepreneurship. Coming up with a project that we had to figure out how to run. </p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, I took a few entrepreneurial classes — like Ed Shil's class really awesome. He would bring in these super experienced entrepreneurs that would share their stories and you get ask them how they navigate it all. (<em>Editor's note: Ed Shil is no longer teaching this. <a href=\"https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/index.cfm?gridterm=2016C&amp;gridcourse=MGMT265&amp;griddept=MGMT\">MGMT265: Culture of Technology</a>, taught by Vice Dean Rosenkopf is very similar and currently offered.</em>) </p>\n\n<p>Also, an OPIM class back in the day was a mixed Wharton and Engineering class where you would come up with a startup and pitch it to VCs at the end of the class (Editor's note: This course is now <a href=\"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/entrepreneurship/eas445-545.php\">EAS445/545: Engineering Entrepreneurship</a>). These sort of hands-on courses include having to navigate ideas and build up business plans, create mockups or the original web site, what the plans would be, marketing plan, logo, and what the target markets would be. </p>\n\n<div id=\"repeated\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>So pertaining to this very hands-on approach to entrepreneurship, if you were designing an entrepreneurial curriculum for your kids is that the approach you would take?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Yeah, if I tried to teach entrepreneurship. I would actually start in seventh grade and do a ten-year program, through high school and college. It would have a dashboard that would track you along the way to see what you're doing well at and what you still need to improve on. And each year, I would do three sections in my class starting in seventh grade. So the first section will be the theory where you learn the material. The second would be your hands-on having to start a company and bring it to market part. And the third section would be learning and reviewing everything: what happened and what went well, what didn't go well, what you can improve on. And I'll do it for ten years in a row so you get practice at bringing the idea to market and the process of probably failing a lot, and learning a lot from this failure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You said in another interview, one of the best things you can do for the world is to empower entrepreneurs. Where do colleges and universities fit into that in the future?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Colleges and universities need to provide the education that is helpful for students to get careers and improve the world, whether that is pre-law, writing, finance or pre-med. I do think that being inspired to become an entrepreneur is super valuable. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>We all think of our entrepreneurs as having very little education, very little practice, that they just jump off a cliff and start companies — taking all the risk in the world. If we strive to provide more guidance to inspire entrepreneurs, we would be in a better place. </mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>How do you have the creative confidence to take that kind of leap of faith, to jump off this cliff to start your companies?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I grew up with immigrant parents.

[10 Hours of Walking in LA as a Woman ... with a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo)\n\n---\n\n**Tell us about your undergraduate experience.**\n\nSo I actually transferred to Penn my sophomore year. I spent my first year at Middlebury College in Vermont. But it wasn't the right fit for me. I had grown up in a small town, I wanted to break free a little bit, and Middlebury didn't have the diversity that I was looking for. There wasn't a very large lesbian population to be honest with you, nor was there a very large Jewish population and I felt like I didn't fit in. \n\n>==It just wasn't the best experience for me. I found myself trying a lot of new things that were very unlike me which was cool, such as playing rugby. But also at the same time there weren’t outlets for the things I really wanted to be doing.==\n\n So I transferred to Penn.\n\nI had always been a debater in high school. I was the captain of our team and I was the 2009 Washington State Lincoln Douglass Debate champion. Naturally, I thought I was going to be debating at Penn. But then, I met somebody who said, \"You're really funny, you should try comedy.\" So on a whim, I auditioned for Bloomers, Penn’s all female sketch comedy group. I had a whole lot of fun auditioning, which also ended up becoming my “big time.” I got in and I fell in love with it. It felt like, “Oh wow, this is the missing piece.” \n\nMy skill was communicating, so I was naturally great at debate. But when I started doing comedy, I realized that this is was I should be doing.\n\n**Were you always funny or did you have to train for the bloomers audition?**\n\n>==I think I always had that sense of humor. I think that the thing that I had to learn was how to format my humor in a way other people could find funny, not just off the cuff stuff but things that are performed again and again.==\n\n When I first was in Bloomers I wasn't the head writer. My senior year I was the head writer. We all had a lot of input in the direction of the show and we would all submit sketches submit work and work on stuff together. \n\nSo in my junior summer before my senior year I interned for the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York. I was in New York and I was seeing as many shows as I could and trying to write as much as possible really with the intention of trying to be a performer and a comedian when I graduated. Also at Penn I wrote for 34th Street Magazine, and senior year I was the editor of the Low Brow section. I also took a comedy writing seminar that is not offered right now but was taught by this amazing guy, Lew Schneider, one of the executive producers and writers of Everybody Loves Raymond. He's really well known in the entertainment industry. \n\nNow he is a producer for The Goldbergs. And he had a seminar where he had a few months off from the business, so he would Skype with us and fly in once a month to Penn and we would all meet. \n\n**When did the YouTube videos start and when did you decide you were going to try this comedy thing for real?**\n\nSo I started doing video stuff when I was 10. I worked on a video trailer with the people who did Classless TV. I don't know if that's still a thing at Penn, but [we did this thing where we can crashed Bid Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G67bwQSdRm0). Everyone was passing out bids and we made up a fake sorority called DTF, Delta Theta Feta, and we had these ridiculous shirts made. Kelly Diamond was the one who came up with this idea. \n\nBefore graduation, I was trying to decide between New York and L.A. and I honestly just felt like I didn't really like New York City enough. I felt it was the kind of city where you had to be rich to really feel comfortable. I had friends in L.A. and I'm from Seattle so I wanted to go back to the West Coast. I moved out a couple of weeks after I graduated. And then when I was out here I started doing more sketches.\n\n**What gave you the inspiration for these videos: [Sex By Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1ZIVwUKE6M) and [10 Hours of Walking in L.A. as a Woman with a Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo)?**\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ZIVwUKE6M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWhen I was a young kid I wrote a lot of songs, like about being a lesbian or coming out of the closet. They were really emotional songs on the ukulele.  And so I had this library of music that wasn't really usable anymore. And I asked, what if these melodies and songs I've written could be turned into jokes? So I started writing comedy songs and I didn’t have videos for all of them but I did them live in comedy for clubs in L.A, and then [Sex By Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo) was one of my favorites. And I thought it'd be really cool to do it visually so that's why I did the puppet video with an audio recording from a live performance and put that up. I got the idea for Sex By Numbers because I was thinking about how silly it was that 69 was named 69 because of the actual shape that people were in, and I was like that's so stupid. \n\n>==And so I thought about what other names you could play with if you started on that sex by numbers concept. And so then I started writing out numbers and thinking what do they look like sexually.==\n\n I thought 22 looked like you were doubled over in pain, so what if we say it's two people in the fetal position because they have food poisoning? So that was sort of the base idea for that. \n\n**And then the [10 Hours of Walking in LA as a Woman With a Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo)?**\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXayJRSHuRo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI watched the original [10 Hours of Walking as a Woman in New York](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A) which was exposing catcalling and I realized that's never happened to me in LA. But what does happen to me is whenever I walk my dog people pull their cars over and literally catcall to him. I thought it’d be funny to show how much dogs get called too and at the same time bring more light to the original video. It's really funny if you actually look at some of the comments.\n\n**What did you do after Penn?**\n\nI was just trying to make as much content as I could. The first job I got was as a producer for a celebrity news television show called OK TV based on OK magazine. I would go to red carpets and I'd be off camera and interview celebrities or I would produce segments and then I would actually edit the segments together for the show. I was totally out of my element, I'd never done anything like that before, but I learned fast and it was something I enjoyed. Then I got offered a job through my friend Caroline Yost, who was a Bloomer. She was working as a production assistant on Mozart in the Jungle and they needed a new one because Carolyn had to leave. They only needed me for a couple months, but I knew the opportunity was in scripted TV, which was what I wanted to be moving toward anyway. I left my job to do it and then after a couple months they were pretty much done, the writers’ room had disbanded, and so I started working one on one with some of the writers a little bit, helping them out with pitch documents or editing. I felt like for the first time I was doing more writer’s assistant-y stuff which is what everybody who wants to be a writer wants to to first. That's different from a writer’s production assistant who sort of gets you coffee which is what my job was in Mozart in the Jungle. The writer’s assistant is sort of an assistant writer, they help keep track of everything. So I started doing sort of freelance writer’s assistant work for some of the writers on the show. I was Luke Wilson's personal assistant for ten seconds, that was fun.\n\nBut then I left that job to work as the story and editorial production assistant on the Scooby Doo movie at Warner Brothers. \n\nSo that's what I was doing before I left the entertainment industry. \n\n\n**Where does Fresh Prints come in?**\n\nThis whole time I was also working as an artist for Fresh Prints, and even since my since my senior year at Penn. A friend at Penn was friends with the guy who started Fresh Prints. I got hired to work freelance as one of the designers. And then I did that up until up until I started working with them full time, and now it has been four amazing years.\n\n*[Fresh Prints](https://freshprints.com/product/gallery) is where you want to go for custom apparel. There are local sales managers that make sure your order experience is top notch and they deliver the best artwork for Student Groups, Greek Organizations, University Administrations, and Intramural Teams thanks to Lizzie's hard work*\n\n**And how long have you been illustrating.**\n\nMy whole life. I was always obsessed with drawing. When I was a kid, at recess I'd be in the library drawing instead of outside playing. And I just loved it. \n\n<div id=\"monetize\"></div>\n\n**And what spurred the full time commitment to Fresh Prints**\n\nI had a bit of a complicated moment. I always thought that the key to being happy in your job, was taking something that you love doing for free, and make money doing it. I loved comedy and writing and performing and coming up with funny ideas. And so I thought that if I could find a way to make money doing that or in that realm that I would be happy. \n\nBut that was a misconception. \n\nI realized that there were parts of the entertainment industry that I really didn't like: the way people treated each other, the way that the product is viewed as more important than the people who are making the product, the way that money is prioritized above everything, and the way there's a lot of instability. \n\nAnd I decided that, at that time, I thought I wanted to be a rabbi because I had always been interested in Judaism and I felt like there wasn't any soul in the business. And so I wanted to go as far from that as possible to something that had a lot of soul in it which is like being a rabbi. So my idea was I'll quit and I'll work for Fresh Prints and then after a couple of years I'll go to school to be a rabbi. \n\nI'm still very religious and spiritual. I'm actually planning on writing a musical about a famous Jewish figure with a fellow Penn alum. So I still want to write and create things. I just needed to take some time off because I realized I loved  performing but when I started performing every single night the same shit over and over again, it became a job. And so I realized it's not about doing what you like. No matter how much you love it there's going to be a day where you don't want to do it. There's going to be a time when you don't want to get out of bed and get up and do it. And at that point it becomes a job. And so it's not something you like anymore. \n\n>==And it's probably something you take for granted but I felt it had been PUMPED into me: \"Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life, find something you love.\" And what I realized was that it's not about having a job where you do something you love, it's about having a job that you love.==\n\nAnd so there are things about my job now that I love so much like working with amazing people, creating something that actually gets produced and made, getting to create art all day, getting to work from home and having that flexibility. \n\nThat type of environment I love. And so I love my job. \n\nSo a big thing I think I realized career-wise was that you kind of get told to take something you love and monetize it. But I don't think that that's necessarily a recipe for happiness. \n\n<div id=\"shit\"></div>\n\n**Do you want to go back to the entertainment industry?**\n\nIt's not that I want to go back into the industry. It's that I want to create stuff again. So I don't want to go work as an assistant again, ever. I don't want to go work on some production that I'm not invested in, ever. I love my job. But it is important to me to write and create and it is not the case that you need to be an assistant in order to get somebody to read your shit. And if your shit is good, that's all that matters. I'm just removing myself from the hustle, and I'm going to create and work on stuff because I want to do creative work and if people are into it they're into it. It's not a money making thing for me. \n\n**What did you do each of your summers at Penn?**\n\nSummer before I came to Penn I did nothing, I went home and just did nothing the summer between my sophomore and junior year. I studied PPE, so the summer before my sophomore and junior year. I worked for the Decision Education Foundation which was an internship program to help devise a program to help teach concepts from decision theory to fifth and sixth graders. I also worked as a researcher for the School of Public Policy for Dr. Susan Sorenson, who is an incredible person and academic who's still a Penn. At one point I interviewed for an internship at The Daily Show. But I fucked it up so I didn't get it. They saw my resume and thought I wanted to be a lawyer. And soon as I started talking about wanting to be a comedian, they were like, “No.” \n\n**So at the end of the day what would you consider yourself an illustrator a comedian or a storyteller?**\n\nOnly time will tell what the narrative connecting everything is in my life. But I think the biggest thing is just creating things and trying to bring that into everything I do in my life. It's kind of been a blessing and a curse for me, I have a lot of interest which is cool but it's also hard. It's not like there is one thing I can devote my whole life to. \n\nThat said, Fresh Prints is a huge part of my life. We're doing real cool stuff and growing really really fast.\n\n<div id=\"penn\"></div>\n\n**What is something you're definitely going to do in the future?**\n\nThe play I’m writing is religious. It's going to be more dark humor. I'm working on it with my friend Sam Pasternack, who's also a Penn alum. \n\n>==I think the biggest theme of what I've been saying is all these names are all people who went to Penn and we're all still friends who have a common goal. I think just keeping in touch with the people from Penn and creating with them is so important.==\n\nYou really never know when you're going to need to know a composer or when you're going to need a designer. Right now I'm helping my friend design a thing for a flyer for my friend's play that’s going to be in a Fringe festival in Edinburgh. The cool thing about Penn is you're surrounded by people who are similarly driven and who similarly have stories to tell and the creatives all help each other out. It's cool. \n\n**Tell me more about Fresh Prints.**\n\nOur goal is to help student entrepreneurs grow businesses on their campuses. Three of the four execs right now, not including me, started their own businesses and sold them before they were 20. So they want to help give similar opportunities to kids. \n\n>==We want to help kids grow their own businesses. So we print custom apparel T-shirts growing really quickly. Our best campus manager did over 200,000 dollars last semester in sales. ==\n\nIt's an amazing experience to actually talk to all these college students and work with them. We have a team of artists, both student artists who work freelance and employees who are overseas, who I work with really closely and we can create custom art for whatever you need from the ground up. So that's my side of it, everything creative. And we get to grow really fast and be part of a really exciting business.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

She has worked as an independent writer's assistant, content creator, and production assistant for Warner Bros, all while working with her growing <a href=\"https://freshprints.com/product/gallery\">Fresh Prints</a> team since her senior year at Penn.

I spent my first year at Middlebury College in Vermont. But it wasn't the right fit for me. I had grown up in a small town, I wanted to break free a little bit, and Middlebury didn't have the diversity that I was looking for. There wasn't a very large lesbian population to be honest with you, nor was there a very large Jewish population and I felt like I didn't fit in. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>It just wasn't the best experience for me. I found myself trying a lot of new things that were very unlike me which was cool, such as playing rugby. But also at the same time there weren’t outlets for the things I really wanted to be doing.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I transferred to Penn.</p>\n\n<p>I had always been a debater in high school. I was the captain of our team and I was the 2009 Washington State Lincoln Douglass Debate champion. Naturally, I thought I was going to be debating at Penn. But then, I met somebody who said, \"You're really funny, you should try comedy.\" So on a whim, I auditioned for Bloomers, Penn’s all female sketch comedy group. I had a whole lot of fun auditioning, which also ended up becoming my “big time.” I got in and I fell in love with it. It felt like, “Oh wow, this is the missing piece.” </p>\n\n<p>My skill was communicating, so I was naturally great at debate. But when I started doing comedy, I realized that this is was I should be doing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Were you always funny or did you have to train for the bloomers audition?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>I think I always had that sense of humor. I think that the thing that I had to learn was how to format my humor in a way other people could find funny, not just off the cuff stuff but things that are performed again and again.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I first was in Bloomers I wasn't the head writer. My senior year I was the head writer. We all had a lot of input in the direction of the show and we would all submit sketches submit work and work on stuff together. </p>\n\n<p>So in my junior summer before my senior year I interned for the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York. I was in New York and I was seeing as many shows as I could and trying to write as much as possible really with the intention of trying to be a performer and a comedian when I graduated. Also at Penn I wrote for 34th Street Magazine, and senior year I was the editor of the Low Brow section. I also took a comedy writing seminar that is not offered right now but was taught by this amazing guy, Lew Schneider, one of the executive producers and writers of Everybody Loves Raymond. He's really well known in the entertainment industry. </p>\n\n<p>Now he is a producer for The Goldbergs. And he had a seminar where he had a few months off from the business, so he would Skype with us and fly in once a month to Penn and we would all meet. </p>\n\n<p><strong>When did the YouTube videos start and when did you decide you were going to try this comedy thing for real?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I started doing video stuff when I was 10. I worked on a video trailer with the people who did Classless TV. I don't know if that's still a thing at Penn, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G67bwQSdRm0\">we did this thing where we can crashed Bid Day</a>. Everyone was passing out bids and we made up a fake sorority called DTF, Delta Theta Feta, and we had these ridiculous shirts made. Kelly Diamond was the one who came up with this idea. </p>\n\n<p>Before graduation, I was trying to decide between New York and L.A. and I honestly just felt like I didn't really like New York City enough. I felt it was the kind of city where you had to be rich to really feel comfortable. I had friends in L.A. and I'm from Seattle so I wanted to go back to the West Coast. I moved out a couple of weeks after I graduated. And then when I was out here I started doing more sketches.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What gave you the inspiration for these videos: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1ZIVwUKE6M\">Sex By Numbers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo\">10 Hours of Walking in L.A. as a Woman with a Dog</a>?</strong></p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ZIVwUKE6M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>When I was a young kid I wrote a lot of songs, like about being a lesbian or coming out of the closet. They were really emotional songs on the ukulele.  And so I had this library of music that wasn't really usable anymore. And I asked, what if these melodies and songs I've written could be turned into jokes? So I started writing comedy songs and I didn’t have videos for all of them but I did them live in comedy for clubs in L.A, and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo\">Sex By Numbers</a> was one of my favorites. And I thought it'd be really cool to do it visually so that's why I did the puppet video with an audio recording from a live performance and put that up. I got the idea for Sex By Numbers because I was thinking about how silly it was that 69 was named 69 because of the actual shape that people were in, and I was like that's so stupid. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>And so I thought about what other names you could play with if you started on that sex by numbers concept. And so then I started writing out numbers and thinking what do they look like sexually.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I thought 22 looked like you were doubled over in pain, so what if we say it's two people in the fetal position because they have food poisoning? So that was sort of the base idea for that. </p>\n\n<p><strong>And then the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo\">10 Hours of Walking in LA as a Woman With a Dog</a>?</strong></p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXayJRSHuRo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>I watched the original <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A\">10 Hours of Walking as a Woman in New York</a> which was exposing catcalling and I realized that's never happened to me in LA. But what does happen to me is whenever I walk my dog people pull their cars over and literally catcall to him. I thought it’d be funny to show how much dogs get called too and at the same time bring more light to the original video. It's really funny if you actually look at some of the comments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did you do after Penn?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was just trying to make as much content as I could.

She is now the Managing Director of Operations & Information at KIPP Bay Area Schools.\n\n*Editor: Education reform always resonated with me as one of the most impactful issues to rally behind. However, outside of going into teaching or politics, I wasn't sure how else to get involved. Ruchi really put into perspective how college students can use their skills to make a social change.*\n ------\n**So you went from consulting to the Clorox Company to data in education — wow. To start off can you give us a quick preface of your interesting career journey.**\n\nI started off doing marketing consulting. Marketing is an area that people often treated as very fuzzy, but I knew that there was a very analytical side of it, and wanted to learn it. After a few years in New York City, I went back for my MBA at Kellogg to move into brand management.\n\nWhen I decided to make a career switch, I had a family situation. I lost my father, and it made me take a step back from my career and really think about what I wanted to do. During that time I realized that I spent a lot of personal time volunteering in the education space, but I had never thought about it as a career before. So I just decided to jump in and see how I could contribute.\n\nMy first role in education was on the data team for a network of charter schools called KIPP. Now I oversee the operations, tech, and data departments here. \n\n**It’s quite a shift to jump from private sector into public sector. Did you use any resources to help you make that transition?**\n\nI joined the [Broad Residency](http://www.broadcenter.org/residency/), which is a project funded by billionaire Eli Broad. They find people at higher levels of talent in the private sector and get them to switch to the education industry. Through this, I got a master's degree in Education Leadership. It was a rigorous program but worth it — it helped me make connections with different school districts and charter organizations that if I had applied to right off the bat, they likely would not have understood my previous private industry experience. There's also a program called [Education Pioneers](http://www.educationpioneers.org/) that takes in people of all levels.\n\n<div id=\"too-many-unknowns\"></div>\n**What's the most challenging analytics project you've done so far?**\n\nEverything is really challenging. It’s not like university research in which you have thousands of students that you're running regressions off of. Right now in education, there's a big trend around blended learning through the use of technology in schools and programs like Khan Academy. *(Editor's note: Blended education is a style of teaching that combines online video instruction with instructor-led practices)*\n\nWe're always trying to understand if that has a positive impact on our students’ education. But, I think the lesson learned is exactly as you stated — there are so many things going on with individual students that it's hard to come up with broad generalizations. It's not as simple as this group of kids used the program and this other group didn't. In reality, they have different teachers, they might have used the program differently for a different amount of time, or they might have started at a different level than another class. So there are just so many factors that it's really hard to understand the benefit of some of these programs when they're used so differently. \n\nOne of the things I’ve learned from that is not to get too caught up in needing statistically significant regression analyses all the time. Oftentimes, you can get quick directional learning that is enough to make you feel confident to make a decision without getting everything perfect. \n>==*It's like that mantra that “perfect can be the enemy of good”, and it can get in your way if you try to do something to the T.*==\n\n<div id=\"education-reform\"></div>\n**What are some metrics you have to see how successful KIPP is being in engaging the students, outside of just traditional test scores and performance?**\n\nFirst of all, we try to get teachers who look like our students because they can connect better. There is a difference when you're a young black boy and you have a black male teacher. We want them to have role models and see the world of possibilities and professions there are for them.\n\nBeyond that, we think a lot about being what we call “culturally competent”. Kids know when you genuinely care about them. A lot of our focus of being culturally responsive is to not use the textbooks that are written by the winners. \n\n>==*In the U.S., a lot of the winners are white, so we try to have a lot of different texts in the classroom written by authors that are Latino, African American, Native American, or Asian American — just all different backgrounds.*==\n\nWe want to compare other narratives and perspectives with every moment in history we’re teaching about. The core thing is building relationships and recognizing that education should reflect and celebrate their background as well. \n\n**How much of a role does KIPP try to play in tackling social issues these kids face that interfere with their education (e.g. poverty, racial discrimination, parental incarceration)?**\n\nOne of the biggest things we do is focusing as equally on culture and character-building as we do on academics. Ninety percent scores on a state test doesn’t necessarily mean students will automatically thrive if they went to a school like Penn. We build their character up to help them succeed anywhere, focusing on curiosity, social intelligence, self-control, and independent thinking.\n\nCulture is a big part of our school because of the unstable home conditions that many students may come from. We have a lot of school support, including psychologists and mental health professionals. We try to focus on restorative practices, emotional learning, and anything to keep students involved in school instead of outside. If a student misbehaves, instead of suspending them, we keep them in the school community and teach them why their behavior is wrong, how to respond to conflicts in a non-physical way, and ways to solve them. School is a safe-haven for these students. We train our teachers on classroom management and how to deal with these types of issues. There’s a lot going on in these students’ lives and we need to give them an outlet here.\n\n**Do you have a certain memory or anything that you keep to motivate yourself every day to keep striving in this role?**\n\nI think of my dad a lot. When my dad passed away from cancer, I reflected on my career and committed to making this change. We are an immigrant family and he worked so hard to get me access to the education that I had. My parents instilled the value of education in me forever. In my household, it was *when* you go to college, not *if* you go to college. Growing up, I never realized that could be different from other families and took it for granted. I think of him and tell my story often because it's important for other people to know why I’m committed to this work. \n>==*Even though I haven't been much of a teacher myself, I chose this very consciously and believe in it because education has leveled the playing field for my family firsthand.*==\n\n**I'm sorry to hear that. It's great that you were able to turn it into such strong motivation. What do you try to work on now to advance the future of education?**\n\nTechnology's got to be a critical part of education because it's a critical part of our everyday lives. A lot of our students don't have access to computers in their home. If we didn't have Chromebooks in our classroom, then we would be missing out on the opportunity to give our kids exposure to what they may see every day at work. \n\nOne part will be universal basic access to technology in a classroom. Then the second part is using that technology to provide good teaching content. Our teachers are absolutely incredible, and they work so hard. To have access to materials that could make their job a little bit more sustainable, so that they're not always creating lesson plans from scratch is a big deal. \n\nPart of this comes with the rise of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). The idea that people all around the world can have access to quality education is great. I hope that we leverage it more.\n\n**It’s interesting you mention MOOCs. Some people love that they can replace formalized education and allow anyone to gain skills on their own. But one big issue they're running into is the low retention rate, low engagement rate, and accountability problem.**\n\nCan I add to that? I think MOOCs have a different goal. MOOCs want more access. They're breaking that barrier to access and giving a broad range of people access to content they wouldn't have access to otherwise. It is achieving that, but like you said, there's a major retention problem. \n\nWhen we're talking elementary, middle, and high school, we're talking about the core content of public education. So the goal isn't just access. It’s to actually master the content. If you just leave them on their own with the material, you don't have that interplay to really understand if they're mastering the content. It's more of how do we layer this with the teacher to give people different ways to interact with the material and master the different skills that we're trying to teach. \n\n<div id=\"make-an-impact\"></div>\n**Shifting to the careers side, what do you suggest students interested in working in education do to prepare?** \n\nThey should get exposure to what the classroom looks like and getting in front of kids, whether it's through a volunteer assignment or student teaching. By getting in front of kids regularly, you can understand if that's what motivates you. I taught English just one summer abroad, and it was hard! I was exhausted every single day and it was rewarding in a lot of ways, but I also came out of that experience with some good clarity that this isn't the best way that I can contribute to this space. \n\n>==*You have to be the kind of person that can actually get energized from that. When I see that lightbulb go off for a kid, that's the best thing in the world.*==\n\nIf you're doing more of the behind the scenes work, you can be very mission oriented and practice different skills. But, you have to be okay with having a little bit more distance from the student. You're working on more systems and processes, and working more through the principals and assistant principals than you are in the classroom with kids. \n\n**Were there any activities or classes you leveraged at Penn around education?**\n\nI loved volunteering, and the [West Philadelphia Tutoring Project](http://upennwptp.weebly.com/) was my first exposure to working in schools in West Philly. I also took this class with Professor Richard Shell on advanced negotiations. Classes like that make you reflect and think about material in a different way. *(Editor's note: Professor Shell's [negotiations classes](https://lgst.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/shellric/#teaching) include OIDD291 and LGST206).*\n\n**Are there any books that influenced you or inspired you most?**\n\nWell, I read a ton of education books. If people are interested in understanding a little bit more about KIPP, there's a book called [How Children Succeed](https://www.amazon.com/How-Children-Succeed-Curiosity-Character/dp/0544104404) by Paul Tough. It talks about research done by Angela Duckworth from Penn on grit and the role of perseverance in your life outcomes that KIPP has used. *(Editor's note: [Angela Duckworth](https://wpa.wharton.upenn.edu/angela-duckworth/) is a distinguished psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania).*\n\nIf you want a new perspective on what our African-American population goes through in the U.S., there’s a book called [The New Jim Crow](http://newjimcrow.com/) that talks about how even though we did away with segregation, there's still a lot of structural ways that African-Americans have been oppressed in our country. \n ------\n*Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee. They do not represent KIPP or any of the other individuals or institutions named above.*\n\n*Header photo courtesy of KIPP Charter Schools.*\n",

To be creative, be strongly in touch with an idea and [bring it into the world.](http://thesign.al/p/andrew-yang-working-on-important-problems/creativity)\n2. Everything is going to be fine.

Write down what you want for yourself, what you care about, and what you'd like to work on. [Writing it down helps to make it real.](http://thesign.al/p/andrew-yang-working-on-important-problems/write-it-down)\n\n ------\nAndrew is the CEO and founder of Venture For America. After graduating from Brown University, Andrew pursued his J.D. at Columbia Law School before working at a variety of startups. He eventually landed at Manhattan Prep, becoming the CEO before Manhattan Prep was eventually acquired by Kaplan in 2009.\n\n*Editor: I stumbled across Andrew's writings on the future of work in a technologically charged society. Andrew's work at Venture for America, a fellowship program that connects recent graduates with jobs at startups, is trying to imagine a future where work is generative, meaningful, and inclusive.*\n -----\n\n**Tell us about your journey from Phillips Exeter Academy to Brown University for undergrad and then your law degree at Columbia Law School?**\n\nI graduated from Brown with an economics degree and was not sure what to do so I took the LSAT and went to law school. After law school at Columbia, I became a corporate attorney at Davis Polk & Wardwell.\n\nI was being paid for doing detail-intensive work and I felt like I was going to become a different sort of person over time if I stayed. I looked around me and saw that there weren't other people there whose lives and careers I wanted for myself.\n\nSo I thought, you're definitely going to leave this place eventually, and it's only going to get harder, not easier, to leave over time. So with those things given I thought logically, I should leave immediately. \n\nI left after five months to start a company called Stargiving.com with a colleague and I did not know much about starting a business at that time. I hustled for seed money, eventually raised some and then we built a web site and launched. But then the bubble was bursting at this time and no one cared about my little company after a while. So we shut the company down after about a year and a half. \n\nAt this point I was a failed entrepreneur with education loans of over a hundred thousand dollars that I had taken out for law school. But at this point I'd been bitten by the bug and I said, \"Wow, trying to start a company was much much more genuine and challenging and invigorating than being in a law firm.\"\n\nAnd so the question I faced then was the question that many people who are graduating from Penn are thinking about: how to move in an entrepreneurial direction. I'm guessing most Penn students do not think they're situated such that they could start a company today and that's probably right. So the way I tried to develop was I worked for more experienced entrepreneurs, first at a mobile software company that did not work out. And then at a healthcare software company where I learned a lot, then I eventually became the CEO of Manhattan Prep. That was the fourth or fifth startup I worked at and then that company grew and grew and I had a great run with that company for the next five and a half years. \n\nSo I can relate to many of the anxieties and issues that Penn students are facing. You're some of the best students in the country and get heavily recruited by name-brand banking, consulting, and tech firms, and it seems like a no brainer to compete for those offers and take them. \n\nOn the flip side though some of you have spent summers at these firms and have not enjoyed it. Or you have friends who are at these firms and tell you horror stories about how they don't enjoy it and have very little time outside of work. And so you think: Wow, is this really what success is like? Am I supposed to take one of these jobs and compete because I'm supposed to? And is there is there something else I could or should be doing? But the other alternatives don't come to Penn and recruit you. So it's a really challenging landscape. And people who go to graduate programs in my experience end up deferring those issues for several years and then face them eventually anyway.\n\n<div id=\"creativity\"></div>\n\n**If you were back in college would you study something other than economics or law?**\n\nI would either be technical or creative if I could do it over again. I think because we are in a world where if you are technical you can create opportunities for yourself more easily. But I think that creativity is at a premium now today too. And it's interesting how little creativity finds its way into many corporate contexts. \n\n**And what do you mean by being creative?**\n\nThe way I see creativity is being in touch with something that you originate and feel strongly enough where you want to bring it into the world. When most people hear creative they think artist, musician, or writer. And those are manifestations of creativity. But to me creativity can mean starting an organization that you think solves a problem, rounding up people to do something that you care about, or building a business. And I think the act of putting out into the world something you believe in and trying to get people to pay attention to it or rally to it is creativity.\n\n**And would you say creativity is a skill that can be taught or can be deliberately developed?**\n\n>==*We all start out creative. We are then trained away from it. That was my experience when I was an economics major. And so in my case I think I re-discovered my creativity almost a decade later.*==\n\nI was named one of the 100 most creative people by Fast Company a few days ago. I was really surprised by it. I don't even consider myself a creative. I've broadened my sense of creativity to include starting organizations and other things. By now I'm a bigger fan of pushing people in those directions. \n\nSo if you you're a student at Penn and you're an economics major, it's not necessarily like go take a painting or art class. Instead, reflect on the things that animate you, and understand it doesn't need to be profound. It could just be that your dorm really needs a book club or a basketball club or a potluck. And to make things happen — that's being creative. \n\nWhile I was struggling in the startup world in my twenties, I started throwing parties. And the business training from throwing parties is insane. It is some of the the best business training. \n\nBut if you think about it, you have to have the vision to get people behind it, you have to organize a team, gather resources, and pay attention to key variables. You also have to be disciplined enough to not care what others think and to a degree also care that they think. So there are things like that that I would advise people to to pursue that you don't think of as creative or business training. But I found them to be very applicable.\n\n\n**Does Venture For America (VFA) become more or less relevant as many jobs and opportunities are taken by machines?**\n\nI inventoried all of the companies we work with. And I could not find virtually any that are geared towards dislocating jobs. A lot of this is because of the cities we operate in and the problems they are trying to solve. The vast, vast majority of our companies are what I call generative — if they succeed it's just going to be a win. We're as or more relevant than ever in trying to broaden the growth of businesses and entrepreneurship to more regions because with the increased pace of automation we're going to need more and more vitality and opportunity in places that are not New York or San Francisco.\n\n**Do you think initiatives like V.F.A and opportunity zones can keep up with the pace of automation?**\n\nI think that Penn students are going to see many dramatic things occur in their careers and lifetimes. \n\nNow I'm not worried at all about Penn students because you all are the cream of the crop and there will always be incredible demand for smart people that can help guide organizations and really light the path of innovation. You guys should not be concerned about your own prospects. The dynamics of this economy actually advantage people with your skills and attributes. \n\nThat said I think that right now there are many worrying trends in American life that will affect many other people. That will require a very robust set of responses that we're not really realistically initiating right now. And that needs to change. And that's one of the things I'm most driven by. \n\n<div id=\"everything-will-be-ok\"></div>\n\n**What can students can do to assist those in parts of society where there have been large displacements of jobs and opportunities?**\n\nMaintain a degree of empathy and perspective. When you're young it's very easy to say, \"Hey, my career is uncertain. I've got a struggle ahead of me and I need to focus on that.\"\n\n>==*The single biggest thing is to know that you all are some of the most gifted and sought after young people in the country. So number one maintain empathy. I remember when I was young how anxious I was and it was very hard for me to imagine that no matter what happened, things were going to be fine.*==\n \nBut I'm here to tell you that no matter what, things are going to be fine. Take it from someone who was part of several failed companies and is just fine! I'm a part of several failed companies, I owed $100,000 and in law school debt, and I'm still fine. My parents were concerned about it for a little while but now you know they love it and brag about me all the time. \n\n>==*The first thing is to know that you're going to be fine. The second thing is to try and make your work generative and part of a solution.*==\n\nNow that's a very, very high bar because many of the opportunities that are naturally going to come to Penn students are not going to be generative truthfully. They're going to be market-driven and the market is going to be unkind to many workers in the years to come. So if you can find an organization that if they succeed will end up being a positive force in terms of making opportunities possible for broader numbers of people, that's ideal. If every Penn student were to do that we would actually be in much greater shape because you guys are one of the great collections of human and intellectual capital in the country. So if there were enough Penn students working on generative businesses and companies that would be awesome.\n\n**Imagine a scenario where smart and ambitious students work on non-generative solutions that are unkind and market driven. These solutions will drive many into a form of economic uselessness. In that kind of world, where will both students who are working on these unkind market driven solutions and the workers who are continually losing opportunities derive meaning?**\n\nYou just summarized two ends of a really profound fundamental generational challenge. The issues you described are really going to be the great project of this era — which is what do millions of people that don't have an economic purpose in the workforce do to forge purpose in their community. And to me there are many possibilities in that direction and we're going to have to meaningfully invest in and explore them. \n\nOn the other side if you have a lot of people working on advancing market-based solutions that have neutral or possibly even negative effects for others that may be — and I don't want to let anyone off the hook — but that might be fine if the benefits of that progress are being distributed in ways that make everyone happy.\n\nFor example, trucks driving themselves ought to be a good thing. We can't shy away from it. It's just that this is a very important question as to what that means for real people and real families that currently rely upon driving trucks for a living.\n\n**And does a universal basic income fix everything?**\n\nTo me a universal basic income is a very important part of a set of solutions that we have to consider. Because if you do hit the fast forward button far enough you wind up with a very short list of realistic means of distributing economic value to enough of the population where society continues to advance. It's something that I believe is going to become more and more front and center in the months to come. \n\n<div id=\"write-it-down\"></div>\n\n**You've said if there's anything that you learned in the last six years in building VFA it was that all things remain possible if you pursue ideals. What is the story of how you developed your ideals?**\n\nI really don't want people to feel this pressure to have a sense of their ideals. When I was a senior in college I had pretty much one priority and that was trying to be cool, whatever cool meant. I was just trying to get a date. Or trying get this person to pay attention to me. In my case values got built over time based upon the people you work with and the things you experience and the organizations you're part of.\n\nSo it's not unusual for people to still be grappling with how to articulate their values and how to live those values for years or even decades. It's not unusual. In my case I started to believe that our flow of talent was driving problems for both the people involved in our economy and society and I wanted to change that.\n\nAnd I've been situated such that I believe I could change this problem, which is not a realistic ambition for a lot of people. \n\n>==*And what's funny is I kind of knew that I was part of a moderately narrow group that could have a positive impact if I busted my back for a number of years. So I felt like I needed to do it because if I didn't I'd be failing to live up to my potential.*==\n\nSo don't sweat it if you're still figuring out what it is that you're most motivated by or which you care mostly deeply about. The key is that when the time does come — and it will come — where the universe does speak to you and realize this may be your chance to do something important then you have to take that first big step. The first big step is the hardest. After you take the first big step the other steps just start following. \n\nBut you have to maintain a sensitivity to what opportunities come your way and what chances you get to work on the things you care about. One piece of advice I would leave you with is that you should write down the things you want for yourself, the things you care about, and the things you want to work on. I did that. \n\nAnd then when the opportunities arose to work on those things I said: \"Well, I wrote it down.\" So I was either lying or I need to do this. Writing it down to helps make it real. I was talking to one guy who moved to Ohio and co-founded a venture capital firm there to help the region. He told me he'd written down a list of things he'd like to do in his life. One of them was create thousands of jobs for people that wouldn't have them otherwise. And so he said when the governor of Ohio called him and said, \"Hey, come to Ohio and become my economic development leader?\" And he replied, \"That's on my list!\" \n\n>==*And the same thing happened to me when I had a list of things that I wanted to do. And so when I thought I could try and accomplish some of them with Venture for America I did it. So if you write down what you want to do and what you care about it will prove immensely valuable over time.*==\n\n\n",

After graduating from Brown University, Andrew pursued his J.D. at Columbia Law School before working at a variety of startups. He eventually landed at Manhattan Prep, becoming the CEO before Manhattan Prep was eventually acquired by Kaplan in 2009.</p>\n\n<p><em>Editor: I stumbled across Andrew's writings on the future of work in a technologically charged society. Andrew's work at Venture for America, a fellowship program that connects recent graduates with jobs at startups, is trying to imagine a future where work is generative, meaningful, and inclusive.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about your journey from Phillips Exeter Academy to Brown University for undergrad and then your law degree at Columbia Law School?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I graduated from Brown with an economics degree and was not sure what to do so I took the LSAT and went to law school. After law school at Columbia, I became a corporate attorney at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell.</p>\n\n<p>I was being paid for doing detail-intensive work and I felt like I was going to become a different sort of person over time if I stayed. I looked around me and saw that there weren't other people there whose lives and careers I wanted for myself.</p>\n\n<p>So I thought, you're definitely going to leave this place eventually, and it's only going to get harder, not easier, to leave over time. So with those things given I thought logically, I should leave immediately. </p>\n\n<p>I left after five months to start a company called Stargiving.com with a colleague and I did not know much about starting a business at that time. I hustled for seed money, eventually raised some and then we built a web site and launched. But then the bubble was bursting at this time and no one cared about my little company after a while.

It’s important to [reflect and think about what *actually* excites you and motivates you](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#reflect). \n2. [Take steps towards developing the skills you want and finding a network of passionate people from whom you’d want to learn and work with](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#skills). \n3. You should [take risks and minimize regret](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#minimize-regret)! It’s much easier to take risks now — the repercussions of failing are more costly when you get older. [Take as many opportunities to explore, learn, and find out what you’re good at](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#learn).\n([Penn would be a good place to do just that!](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#penn)) \n\nCurtis Lee is the founder and CEO of a startup called [Luxe](http://www.luxevalet.com/), which offers on-demand parking and valet services. After spending a frustrating 40 minutes trying to find parking before a dinner, he came up with the idea (on a napkin at the restaurant) to have someone meet you at your destination and park your car for you. Late April 2017 (after this interview), Luxe decided to [end its valet service operations](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/luxe-to-end-door-to-door-valet-service-in-san-francisco-at-the-end-of-may/) and will launch a new service in the summer.\n\nCurtis only became an entrepreneur later in life: after graduating the University of California Berkeley with a degree in Economics, he followed a “typical” finance path before attending the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business for his MBA. Afterwards, he chose to work at tech companies including Google, Zynga, and Groupon, before starting Luxe in San Francisco. (He’s also a “Believer of the Impossible,” according to his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/curtislee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).) \n ------\n**Penn is really pre-professional, and people just end up falling into finance or consulting, even if they do not like it. How were you able to ultimately pursue Luxe?** \n\nYou mentioned this idea that people in school tend to follow the crowd. They do things that they think are proven paths to take, and oftentimes it's a plan of their parents; they say, “You can be a doctor, you can be an investment banker,” or whatever it is. But, just as the world has changed, the job market has fundamentally changed as well. And so maybe the way to think about this is the *risks that you don’t take are actually the bigger risks that you have to deal with in your life*. People at Penn are very smart, motivated, with high IQs. And so no matter what they up doing, they’ll do pretty well. It’s about the direction in which you go. People that do well are ones that 10, 20, or 30 years after they graduate, they're extremely passionate and happy with their jobs. You get that by following what really gets you motivated. It’s hard, but you should think from *inwards to outwards*. Anytime people have made an “inward-to-outward” decision, I feel like it’s led to a better, more satisfying outcome than just an “outward” decision. \n\n<div id=\"reflect\"> Now there's a whole separate question of where did you find your passion: in school, or maybe you couldn't find it at all, or maybe you need to take some time, but I think it’s worth the extra effort to take a year off to self-reflect. \n> == *I know it sounds so sacrilegious not to have a job after graduation, but it’s worth taking that one year or six months off to really think about it and then ultimately deciding your career, instead of jumping into something and spending two to three years on something that’s ultimately a big waste of time.* ==\n\nTaking it back to me, I think I could have done Luxe a lot earlier had I followed my advice to you, but it took some time for me to understand these life lessons. Around Luxe specifically, I saw a need and a novel approach for fixing a situation. It’s a personal problem of mine, so I’m passionate about it. And, I had a team of people who I wanted to work with. So when you have a combination of a great team and you have something that you want to build, that’s an opportunity to actually start a company. That's what I ended up doing. \n\nMy philosophy on my career at that point in time, only a few years ago, is that you got to take some chances and minimize the regret you have in your life, the risks you think you should’ve taken. \n>==*The repercussions from failure are much easier when you’re younger. You're not typecast as a person that's failed and you learn from it and move on.*==\n \nWhereas when you get older or further in your career, there’s less opportunity — the risk of failing is higher. It gets significantly harder to take on risk when you’re older. There’s more at stake.\n\nSo my point on all of this is that after you graduate you should find something that you're extremely passionate about, and find a set of people that you're excited about doing something with. *And if that means that you have to go to a large company to find that network, so be it*. At Penn, you can find the intelligent people that you really like working with. And then you have to find a problem you’re passion about. \n\n**So about finding the right people, how were you able to find teammates who were just as passionate as you were?** \n\nI think it's a common problem where a lot of people come in more dedicated and devoted than others. I think the key is that you have to work with a person for a while, like a feeling-out process. There's no reason you have to say, “Hey you, you and I should start a company right now,” when we haven't even worked together. So I think there should be a track history of working together in a company or working on a project together at school, so we know how we act and behave especially under pressure. And secondly, you have to find people whose motivations are similar to yours. \n\n**It seems like you’ve always had this entrepreneurial spirit (since age 10, according to this Forbes article). Coming to Wharton for your MBA, how did you explore that passion for entrepreneurship?**\n\n<div id=\"minimize-regret\"> If you look at my pre-MBA, post-undergrad career, it was very safe, the typical finance path: investment banking, private equity funds, venture capital funds. At the time I graduated, it was sort the “cool” path everyone wanted to follow. I felt sort of trapped. I didn't really think about if this was what I wanted to do. The summer before I entered business school, my grandmother ended up passing away. I got to spend time with her at the hospital, and she told me she had a lot of regret in her life, regret that she didn't pursue all the passions. I think that really shook me to the core. Life is super precious. If you always had that dream or passion about doing something on your own, and you never had the guts to go do it — all that stuff goes away at that point in time. If you ever need a point of motivation or a moment of clarity, spend some time in a retirement home because it will really start to clarify what's important in your life.\n<div>\nSo entering business school, I pivoted what I wanted to do out of business school, which was I wanted to eventually start a company. So I geared my education and the internships that I got towards making that a reality. \n<div>\nI did take an entrepreneurship class. In my first year, there was a hardcore entrepreneur in my class, who, after his first year, ended up working on his idea and never came back. He dropped out of Wharton and started the company, [AdMob](https://www.google.com/admob/), which he sold to Google for $750 million dollars. You have a guy who saw a need. He was passionate about it, started building it himself. He could've taken a much more conservative path, could have said, \"I'll just wait one more year. I could work on it on the side.\" But he said, \"I'm going to work on this no matter what because the opportunity is now.\" And it all worked out for him. \n>==*Real entrepreneurship is like [burning the boats](http://travisrobertson.com/leadership/burn-ships-succeed-die/) and saying, “I'm going to work on this, come hell or high water and make it work.” And you go out and do it.*==\n\n**So after pivoting in business school and to the point when you started Luxe, how did you make career changes and job changes? How did you get the knowledge, insight, or skills in order to start Luxe?**\n<div id=\"skills\"> I went from a pure finance path to wanting to start a technology company. I felt like that was where the momentum of the world was moving to: technology will continue to be a growth center for at least like 50 years, in my opinion. So I wanted to be in that space. When I was in finance, I spent some time on some early stage technology investments, got to see a lot of technology company pitches, so I was pretty familiar with a lot of the trends. \n\nBut I never really had the skills around building something, so that’s first and foremost. I knew I had a passion for building things. Often when you start a company, you're building something from scratch. So I needed those skill sets, as well as a network of people that I could start a company with (engineers and product people). \n>==*So I figured out a plan to develop those skills and people. And I did that by getting a job at Google after graduation (from Wharton MBA). I tried to move more towards that path of product management, getting acclimated, learning from the best and brightest people, and then ultimately building a network of people.*== \n\nAnd every step of the way I tried to get more skills, get more leadership responsibilities, and finally when I had an idea, a dream that I thought was worthy of jumping in and taking a chance, that's exactly what I did. \n\n**You went to UC Berkeley as an undergrad, and then Wharton for your MBA. What would you say is the difference between your Wharton experience versus UC Berkeley?** \n\nBroadly speaking, the benefit you get from a Bay Area school is the environment. Some of the most amazing companies are right in your backyard. You could do internships at a lot of these companies and network at a bunch of events. Penn students have to work harder on reaching out to technology and entrepreneurial people to come to campus, finding a way to get in touch with them and being inspired by them. \n<div id=\"penn\"> You have tons of great entrepreneurs who came to Penn though. Penn does have an entrepreneurial culture of people — Wharton people or computer science people — who want to start companies and change the world. While Philadelphia may not be the best place for technology or entrepreneurship, Penn’s school environment is much tighter and better, at least against Berkeley, which is a public school. At Berkeley, there's much more of a sink-or-swim mentality, you can get lost in the shuffle because you're one of thousands and thousands of people. In private schools, there's much more cohesion, and you're set up more for success because the school has more resources. \n<div>\n**What would you want Wharton or Penn to improve on with preparing students to be entrepreneurs, careers in tech, or just in general promoting an entrepreneurial mindset?** \n<div>\nI think Wharton in particular needs to broaden the exposure and its positioning to go beyond finance. Even when I talk to people now, they go \"You must have gotten a great finance education.\" And I think that's a missed opportunity. I think there are opportunities to work hand-in-hand with companies and incubators. One of our investors, who runs YC ([Y-Combinator](www.ycombinator.com), a renowned startup incubator), sent out a Tweet two days ago, saying that business schools don't train their students very well for entrepreneurship. A few hours later, he sent another tweet saying that the Harvard and Stanford business schools were the only two schools that reached out to him, saying they're willing to work with him and YC to improve their curriculum. I wish Wharton reached out to him too. If YC, which is like the best incubator out there, is willing to reach out to schools and help them, then I think that's an opportunity. \n<div>\nSpending some time working at a real company as part of the curriculum would be valuable. Maybe Penn could team up with companies nearby and have students work on a project on behalf of the company. This would give students more real life experience. I also think changing some of the curriculum to be less theoretical and more practical would be interesting as well. Penn could tailor classes more readily around topics that actually matter in entrepreneurship, like sales. Sales is an example of something that an entrepreneur does all the time, and no one talks about that. \n<div>\n**What advice do you have for students who don't think they have the skills but would want to be involved in tech and entrepreneurship?** \n\n<div id=\"learn\"> I'd say that for people your age, *you still have a lot of time*. For people my age, I'd say focus on your strengths, don't focus on your weaknesses. I've taken some coding classes, but I'm only going to be a mediocre coder unless I spend a ton of time developing my skills. So rather than doing that, I have a competitive advantage with product knowledge, analytical skills, and creativity. So that's where I focus my efforts on. When building a team, you want to find complementary pieces to who you are and what skills you have. For me, it was finding a technical cofounder. But at your age, when you're still in school, you still have many opportunities to potentially be a coder. \n>==*I would say the most important thing you can get out of college is discovering what you're good at and what your passions are.*== \n\nTake some of those classes on coding and see if you actually like it or if you want to do something else. \n\n>==*Take the opportunity to learn as much as possible, get a breadth of knowledge and meet different people, and I think you'll get a good start afterwards.*==\n\n-----\n*Header photo courtesy of Mercedez-Benz.com.*",

He was passionate about it, started building it himself. He could've taken a much more conservative path, could have said, \"I'll just wait one more year. I could work on it on the side.\" But he said, \"I'm going to work on this no matter what because the opportunity is now.\" And it all worked out for him.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark><em>Real entrepreneurship is like <a href=\"http://travisrobertson.com/leadership/burn-ships-succeed-die/\">burning the boats</a> and saying, “I'm going to work on this, come hell or high water and make it work.” And you go out and do it.</em></mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So after pivoting in business school and to the point when you started Luxe, how did you make career changes and job changes? How did you get the knowledge, insight, or skills in order to start Luxe?</strong>\n<div id=\"skills\"> I went from a pure finance path to wanting to start a technology company. I felt like that was where the momentum of the world was moving to: technology will continue to be a growth center for at least like 50 years, in my opinion. So I wanted to be in that space. When I was in finance, I spent some time on some early stage technology investments, got to see a lot of technology company pitches, so I was pretty familiar with a lot of the trends. </p>\n\n<p>But I never really had the skills around building something, so that’s first and foremost. I knew I had a passion for building things. Often when you start a company, you're building something from scratch. So I needed those skill sets, as well as a network of people that I could start a company with (engineers and product people).  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark><em>So I figured out a plan to develop those skills and people. And I did that by getting a job at Google after graduation (from Wharton MBA). I tried to move more towards that path of product management, getting acclimated, learning from the best and brightest people, and then ultimately building a network of people.</em></mark> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And every step of the way I tried to get more skills, get more leadership responsibilities, and finally when I had an idea, a dream that I thought was worthy of jumping in and taking a chance, that's exactly what I did. </p>\n\n<p><strong>You went to UC Berkeley as an undergrad, and then Wharton for your MBA. What would you say is the difference between your Wharton experience versus UC Berkeley?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, the benefit you get from a Bay Area school is the environment. Some of the most amazing companies are right in your backyard. You could do internships at a lot of these companies and network at a bunch of events. Penn students have to work harder on reaching out to technology and entrepreneurial people to come to campus, finding a way to get in touch with them and being inspired by them. <br />\n<div id=\"penn\"> You have tons of great entrepreneurs who came to Penn though. Penn does have an entrepreneurial culture of people — Wharton people or computer science people — who want to start companies and change the world. While Philadelphia may not be the best place for technology or entrepreneurship, Penn’s school environment is much tighter and better, at least against Berkeley, which is a public school. At Berkeley, there's much more of a sink-or-swim mentality, you can get lost in the shuffle because you're one of thousands and thousands of people. In private schools, there's much more cohesion, and you're set up more for success because the school has more resources. <br />\n<div> <br />\n<strong>What would you want Wharton or Penn to improve on with preparing students to be entrepreneurs, careers in tech, or just in general promoting an entrepreneurial mindset?</strong> \n<div> <br />\nI think Wharton in particular needs to broaden the exposure and its positioning to go beyond finance. Even when I talk to people now, they go \"You must have gotten a great finance education.\" And I think that's a missed opportunity. I think there are opportunities to work hand-in-hand with companies and incubators. One of our investors, who runs YC (<a href=\"www.ycombinator.com\">Y-Combinator</a>, a renowned startup incubator), sent out a Tweet two days ago, saying that business schools don't train their students very well for entrepreneurship. A few hours later, he sent another tweet saying that the Harvard and Stanford business schools were the only two schools that reached out to him, saying they're willing to work with him and YC to improve their curriculum. I wish Wharton reached out to him too. If YC, which is like the best incubator out there, is willing to reach out to schools and help them, then I think that's an opportunity. <br />\n<div> <br />\nSpending some time working at a real company as part of the curriculum would be valuable. Maybe Penn could team up with companies nearby and have students work on a project on behalf of the company. This would give students more real life experience. I also think changing some of the curriculum to be less theoretical and more practical would be interesting as well. Penn could tailor classes more readily around topics that actually matter in entrepreneurship, like sales. Sales is an example of something that an entrepreneur does all the time, and no one talks about that. <br />\n<div> <br />\n<strong>What advice do you have for students who don't think they have the skills but would want to be involved in tech and entrepreneurship?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><div id=\"learn\"> I'd say that for people your age, <em>you still have a lot of time</em>. For people my age, I'd say focus on your strengths, don't focus on your weaknesses. I've taken some coding classes, but I'm only going to be a mediocre coder unless I spend a ton of time developing my skills. So rather than doing that, I have a competitive advantage with product knowledge, analytical skills, and creativity. So that's where I focus my efforts on. When building a team, you want to find complementary pieces to who you are and what skills you have. For me, it was finding a technical cofounder. But at your age, when you're still in school, you still have many opportunities to potentially be a coder.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark><em>I would say the most important thing you can get out of college is discovering what you're good at and what your passions are.</em></mark> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Take some of those classes on coding and see if you actually like it or if you want to do something else. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark><em>Take the opportunity to learn as much as possible, get a breadth of knowledge and meet different people, and I think you'll get a good start afterwards.</em></mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Header photo courtesy of Mercedez-Benz.com.</em></p>",

Several interactive charts in this article may not appear on mobile.**\n\nWe are taking a quick break from the usual alumni interviews to feature another set of superstars: you, the readers! Some of the best insights come from current students, whose countless collective experiences and lessons learned can be democratized for the betterment of future generations. \n\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Why is this article needed?\nDue to several frantic requests made by freshmen readers about finding that perfect summer internship, we noticed this trend was prevalent across the entire class. As on-campus recruiting (OCR) was pushed to the fall for the first time, from the moment freshmen set foot on campus, the overwhelming presence of professionally-clad upperclassmen with leather portfolios would have made any regular person panic. To alleviate their worries, we made a [public post](https://www.facebook.com/laura.gao.10/posts/1237703422989418) asking upperclassmen to talk about their freshman summer plans. After collecting nearly **70 responses** across 25+ majors, we conducted data analysis to accomplish three things:\n\n>1. Paint a **more transparent picture** for future freshmen regarding their first summers \n2. Provide compelling evidence that freshmen summer plans have **little correlation** towards future plans\n3. **Connect students to upperclassmen** with all types of summers\n\n--------\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Survey Breakdown\nFor each participant, we asked the following:\n![](/content/images/2017/05/data-display-1.png)\n\nMost common majors surveyed are in decreasing order: Finance, Management, Operations & Information Decisions, Marketing, Business Analytics, Computer & Information Science, Statistics, and Biology.\n\n<iframe src=\"/common-majors/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"commonmajors\" style=\"height:450px;width:100%;\"></iframe>\n<p align=\"center\">*Charts may take a few seconds to load.*\n\nAll of the responses were grouped into five general types of summer plans:\n\n* General Business Internship - **41%**\n* Tech or Startup Internship - **22%**\n* Research or Classes - **15%**\n* Travel/Study Abroad - **15%**\n* Non-Profit or High School Job - **7%**\n\n<div class=\"box\">\n<iframe src=\"http://thesign.al/types-of-summers-2-1/\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"typeofsummer\"  scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:425px;width:305px\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<div class=\"box\">\n<iframe src=\"http://thesign.al/types-of-summers-2-2/\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"typeofsummer2\"  scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:425px;width:305px\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<svg width=\"700\" height=\"1\"></svg>\n\nThe methods participants used to attain these plans include:\n\n* Family or friend connection - **34%**\n* Applied directly - **34%**\n* Cold emailed - **19%**\n* High school job continuation or own startup - **13%**\n\n--------\n\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Scoring Metrics: Usefulness and Percent Redos\n\nTwo main metrics we used to determine overall perceptions of a successful summer were: \n\n1. Usefulness scores from 1-10, 10 being most useful\n2. Percentage of people who would redo or change their summer\n\nUsefulness scores were described to participants as a “combination of personal and professional development”. The average scores out of 10 for each type of summer are:\n\n* Travel/Study Abroad - **7.5**\n* Tech or Startups - **7.1**\n* Non-Profit or High School Job - **6.8**\n* General Business - **5.8**\n* Research or Classes - **5.6**\n\n<iframe src=\"/usefulness-scores/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"usefulness\" style=\"height:300px;width:100%\"></iframe>\n\n\n>######<h6 style=color:#2661c3>Key Takeaways:\n\n>1. Students who traveled or studied abroad gave the highest perceived usefulness scores of 7.5.\n2. Students who conducted research or took summer classes on campus gave the lowest perceived usefulness score of 5.6. \n\nParticipants were also asked if they would redo or change their summer, given the chance. The split between students who would redo their summer vs. students who would keep it unchanged was 38% to 63%. Of the students who would choose to redo their summer, the most common reasons are that students wanted to:\n\n* Take advantage of their last chance to travel, be with family, or have fun - **54%**\n* Explore a field more related to their interests - **21%**\n* Gain more useful skills - **21%**\n* Be more prepared before starting an internship - **4%**\n\n<div class=\"box\">\n<iframe src=\"http://thesign.al/redo-by-summer-4-1/\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"redobysummer\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:420px;width:320px\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<div class=\"box\">\n<iframe src=\"http://thesign.al/redo-by-summer-4-2/\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"redobysummer2\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:420px;width:305px\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<svg width=\"700\" height=\"1\"></svg>\n\nIn addition, the percentage of people who would redo or change their summer varied amongst the different summer types: \n\n\n* Tech or Startups - **44%**\n* General Business - **41%**\n* Research or Classes - **40%**\n* Travel/Study Abroad - **27%** \n* Non-Profit or High School Job - **20%**\n\n>######<h6 style=color:#2661c3>Key Takeaways:\n\n>1. Those who had a formal internship, regardless of whether it was in general business, tech, or  startups, had the highest concentration of people who would redo their summer compared to those without internships.\n2. The top reason people would have changed or re-done their summer was undoubtedly because it was perceived to be the last full summer to do something they enjoyed. Common alternative activities were staying longer with family, traveling more, or doing more fun things.\n\n------\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Comparing Freshman Summer with Later Career Plans\nA common fear perpetuated by the pre-professional environment is that the freshmen summer has significant correlation with a student’s future academic and career plans. \n\n**However, the data shows that this couldn’t be further from the truth.**\n\nLess than a third of the students surveyed (30%) are currently pursuing a career in the same field as that of their summer internship. The fields with the highest conversion rates are:\n\n* Tech and Startups - **60%**\n* Financial Services - **53%**\n* Marketing & Analytics - **25%**\n\n**General business internships was split into financial services and marketing & analytics for more accurate insights*\n\nThe pathways chart below shows many of the pivots our participants made from freshmen summer to now:\n\n<iframe src=\"http://thesign.al/career-pathways/\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"height:730px;width:100%\"></iframe>\n\n\n**Despite this, one trend that was apparent in the data was the connection between overall summer satisfaction and major pursued.** \n\nParticipants were split evenly between those whose internship role matched with their current major and those whose did not. Those whose matched had a significantly higher usefulness score of 7.1 out of 10, compared to only 4.3 out of 10 for those whose did not. It is important to note that we did not collect data on changes in major before and after freshman summer. Thus, it is unclear if freshman summer experiences caused better alignment of major preference or initial major preferences caused a better summer experience. \n\n---\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Summer Search Timeline\nLastly, we collected data on start and end dates of each participant’s search for summer plans. The average time spent searching was 2.5 months, with the average participant starting in early February and finishing in mid-April. \n\nThese dates varied across the different summer types:\n\n <googlevistitles>Summer Plans Search Timeline</googlevistitles>\n <br>\n <div id=\"summerplan_timeline\"></div>\n\n>######<h6 style=color:#2661c3>Key Takeaways:\n\n>1. When analyzing correlations between timelines and summer perceptions, there was no change in average usefulness scores regardless of the length of time spent searching for plans. Thus, searching for longer does not necessarily result in a “higher quality” summer.\n2. Students who traveled or studied abroad both started and finished the earliest. Such programs typically close applications in early spring; thus we recommend freshmen who are pursuing these plans to prepare early.\n3. Students who conducted research or took classes on campus had the shortest search timeline. These students recommend being proactive in inquiring professors about their work, and looking into [CURF](https://www.curf.upenn.edu/research) and department-specific research grants.\n\n---\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Final Thoughts\nThis concludes our analysis of freshmen summers from upperclassmen insights. By democratizing this information, we aim to encourage future generations of Penn students to pursue more fulfilling and unique opportunities both in their summers and in post-grad ventures. Most importantly, we recognize the increasing pre-professional pressure caused by the ubiquity of students in suits around campus during the first few months of OCR. Freshman year is for making lifelong friends, developing stronger identities, and taking full advantage of being immersed in a youthful community of changemakers. \n\n**==From all of the writers at The Sign.al, we implore future Quakers to take these words to heart, calm down, and just enjoy the ride.==**\n\n---\n######<h6 style=color:#2661c3>Want to know *everything* from our upperclassmen?\n\nWe weren’t kidding when we said we would democratize everything.

These students recommend being proactive in inquiring professors about their work, and looking into <a href=\"https://www.curf.upenn.edu/research\">CURF</a> and department-specific research grants.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h5 id=\"h4stylecolor2661c3finalthoughts\"><h4 style=color:#2661c3>Final Thoughts</h5>\n\n<p>This concludes our analysis of freshmen summers from upperclassmen insights. By democratizing this information, we aim to encourage future generations of Penn students to pursue more fulfilling and unique opportunities both in their summers and in post-grad ventures. Most importantly, we recognize the increasing pre-professional pressure caused by the ubiquity of students in suits around campus during the first few months of OCR. Freshman year is for making lifelong friends, developing stronger identities, and taking full advantage of being immersed in a youthful community of changemakers. </p>\n\n<p><strong><mark>From all of the writers at The Sign.al, we implore future Quakers to take these words to heart, calm down, and just enjoy the ride.</mark></strong></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h6 id=\"h6stylecolor2661c3wanttoknoweverythingfromourupperclassmen\"><h6 style=color:#2661c3>Want to know <em>everything</em> from our upperclassmen?</h6>\n\n<p>We weren’t kidding when we said we would democratize everything.

Hone in on your communication/professional skills as a freshman - sending concise yet informative emails, taking detailed notes during meetings that can be of help to your team, being organized and being professional are all things not tied specifically to \"finance skills\" that are sometimes overlooked, but still really important for future summers as an aspiring business person.\"* [Contact Senior](mailto:writers+Anonymous@thesign.al)\n\n**Stephanie Cho on how to succeed in a tough finance environment (private equity firm)**:*\"I would have tried to be more confident in my work and also not be afraid to ask questions because that’s how you get assessed to get more work.

While they talked I went to play with and assist in teaching some of the students. I really enjoyed it and asked how I could contribute more deeply.

I taught students in grades K-8 in suburban St. Louis math, robotics, and coding. I also piloted robotics camps in urban St. Louis for underprivileged students who otherwise could not afford these camps. It was very rewarding to get to know the students and watch their progress (especially the kids in the city). By working here my freshman summer, I took part in interesting, fun, and valuable work, that truthfully I probably enjoyed more than I would have enjoyed working in D.C. Overall, I don’t regret how I spent my freshman summer. I was able to catch up with high school friends, spend time with my family, and visit many of my favorite places in St. Louis that I hadn’t visited since going to Penn. I was still successful in finding something to do my sophomore summer, and overall, I was able to have a relaxing, stress-free break from Penn (which is all I needed as a freshman anyways!).\"* [Contact Lauren](mailto:writers+Lauren@thesign.al)\n\n---\n<div id=\"research\"></div>\n####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Research or Classes\n<div id=\"savi\"></div>\n**==Sign.al Mentor==, Savi Joshi on making her [hot cheetos cookbook](https://undergrad.wharton.upenn.edu/student-voices/exploration-through-funding/) and living the monk life (Le Cordon Bleu, monastery)**: *From her [Medium article](https://medium.com/@savijoshi/what-you-can-learn-from-doing-nothing-ed09e00de993) - \"To say that my time at the monastery changed my life would be the easy way out because even the very fact that I chose to step out of bed with my left foot instead of right this morning was also “life-changing.”\nSo let me rephrase that.

For example, working as an RA was very quiet and although the work was interesting, I preferred working with people as a tour guide. I learned the most doing work for the Admissions Office, because I suddenly gained a lot of responsibility and was given the freedom to spearhead new projects. The adults in the office took me seriously and valued my opinions, so my confidence grew as I implemented more ideas. Because the Admissions Office is part of a large bureaucratic system, I also gained exposure to the limitations of a large system and how to manage relationships with multiple departments and compromise. Furthermore, juggling these three responsibilities, I learned how to manage my time better and a truer meaning of hard work. Additionally, I wish I had taken my personal health more seriously. When my work/school life got really busy, my room would be a mess and my eating habits got really out of whack. I often shoved away exercise and personal time to get more work done and this was really unhealthy behavior that I didn't realize at the time!”* [Contact Andrea](mailto:writers+Andrea@thesignal.com)\n\n**Brian Chau on taking easier summer courses (Penn classes)**: *\"I would say the classes themselves weren't incredibly useful but the great thing about getting requirements out of the way is that it allowed me to have a lighter course load around OCR periods (junior and senior year). In addition, summer courses tend to be easier so you can argue that it also helped my GPA vs. if I had taken them normally during the fall/spring semesters. If I could go back, I would still take classes but also do research with a Wharton professor in a field that I am interested in on the side. I knew a few students in my summer classes who did this and I think research experience does help you stand out during interviews.”* [Contact Brian](mailto:writers+brian@thesignal.com)\n\n---\n<div id=\"joinus\"></div>\n####<h6 style=color:#2661c3>Interested in exploring opportunities mentioned here?\nCheck out our **[database](http://thesign.al/database-of-freshmen-focused-summer-resources/)** of freshmen-focused summer opportunities.\n\n######<h6 style=color:#2661c3>Want to help us build this database for future generations?\n\nThe Sign.al will keep this project constantly updated with new summer information.

The adults in the office took me seriously and valued my opinions, so my confidence grew as I implemented more ideas. Because the Admissions Office is part of a large bureaucratic system, I also gained exposure to the limitations of a large system and how to manage relationships with multiple departments and compromise. Furthermore, juggling these three responsibilities, I learned how to manage my time better and a truer meaning of hard work. Additionally, I wish I had taken my personal health more seriously. When my work/school life got really busy, my room would be a mess and my eating habits got really out of whack.

If I could go back, I would still take classes but also do research with a Wharton professor in a field that I am interested in on the side.

            "markdown": "#####**Editor’s Three Key Takeaways**\n\n1. The pace of change around us is mind-blowing. [Be cutting edge and don't be disrupted](#disrupt). The worse thing you can do is think you will never go obsolete.\n2. There are layers and layers that make up the reality around us. Stay [attentive](#attentive). Find problems. Try solutions.\n3. With all the resources around you, it's surprising how quickly and inexpensively you can [build things](#rapid-prototype). Do it.\n\nAfter spending a few years at investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ), Rich Riley stumbled upon an internet problem and decided to build out Log-Me-On.com. It was subsequently acquired by Yahoo, and Rich tagged along for a 13-year stretch, during which he got to experience London and Geneva to work as the Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Yahoo Europe, Middle East and Africa, and eventually switching back to become Executive Vice President, Americas, Yahoo’s largest department. When Rich left Yahoo, he wanted to fill the role of CEO at a company he could really get involved in. Fortunately, Shazam found him and it was love at first sight, and he has been CEO of Shazam for four years and counting.\n\nRich graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 1996, majoring in Finance and Entrepreneurial Management.\n\n---\n\n**What was the path that you took leading up to your first venture?**\n\nI chose Wharton over several other Ivy League schools for the incredible business education. I was very eager to learn from the best and get to Wall Street and thought Wharton that was the best place to do that.\n\nI have always been an entrepreneur. In high school, there was lots of yards and so I had a lawn mowing company. I was always thinking about entrepreneurial ventures, which led to a dual concentration in finance and entrepreneurial management at Wharton. I really enjoyed my work and the entrepreneurial management courses, where the professors brought in real world examples and experiences into the classroom (*Editor’s Notes: MGMT 235: Management of Innovation and MGMT 264: Entrepreneurial Management are great courses that offer this type of exposure. See more [here](https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/teaching/undergraduate-entrepreneurial-paths/)*). I played football my first year and stopped after that. I was president of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and very active in that. \n\n**When did your entrepreneurial aspiration pick up?**\n\nA couple years [into investment banking], I was still working incredible hours but really enjoying it. I was traveling a lot for that role, and then on one airplane ride, I had an idea around organizing usernames and passwords. I asked a good friend of mine in the I.T. group at DLJ if there was a service that does what I was thinking. Keep in mind, this was 1998, so the Internet was really just getting started. To give you an idea, we were just starting to use e-mail as a core business tool. We were quick to say:\n\n>==“Why don't we create one?”==\n\nWith DLJ's blessing, we created a side project and built a service called Log-Me-On.com. The concept was that you would go to Log-Me-On.com, input all your usernames and passwords and this would be the place where you started your internet experience. You would go to Log-Me-On.com and click on the Wall Street Journal and it would automatically log you in. Now, you wouldn't need to always carry around all these usernames and passwords. We built this site, and we were promoting it very guerrilla style. We got thousands of users, and it was going fine. \n\n**How did you really start pushing Log-Me-On.com?**\n\nWe didn’t want to go obsolete. We started asking questions like, “What if you didn't have to go to Log-Me-on.com? What if we were just in the browser?” My friend's brother is an incredibly talented software developer and he figured out how to make something persistent in the browser. At the time, Netscape and Internet Explorer were the two primary browsers. No one had ever done what he figured out, and we quickly realized that we needed to protect this intellectual property. We went and got the best intellectual property attorney that we could get, without much of a budget, and filed a patent on the technology. \n\n**Where did you decide to take the technology?**\n\nWe decided this technology would best be used on a big platform. There were three big Internet companies at the time: Yahoo, Excite, and Lycos. We created mockup toolbars for each and leveraging my network, we were able to get Jerry Yang at Yahoo and George Bell at Excite both interested. Both placed bids for the company, and in the end, we sold it to Yahoo. There were four of us working on the company at the time, and we all moved out to California. In 1999, I joined as the 799th employee of Yahoo in their corporate development group in California.\n\n*Editor’s Note: To reiterate, Rich ended up having a 13-year run at Yahoo. He was there for a lot of dotcom boom and the bust. He attributed his loyalty to the fact that Jerry Yang believed in them. It was a fast-pace environment that kept giving him more responsibility.*\n\n**Your biggest takeaway from Penn?**\n\nOne is the opportunities that I had coming out of Penn were tremendous. You really get catapulted into great roles at great companies that really get your career off to a fast start. I look at a lot of my classmates that have gone on to do really amazing things from that sort of launch pad. I also think that having some of the background that you get at Wharton around finance, modeling, and really understanding the core economics of any business. How business really works and how financial statements come together are thing that are harder to pick up later.\n\nHaving the entrepreneurial management training and seeing lots of real world examples, dealing with a lot of case studies, really hones your instincts at a young age. \n\n**Going off of your comment about the core skill set, how do you choose between breadth versus depth in different topic areas?**\n\nThe core is the most important part. Understanding the fundamentals of accounting and of corporate finance. I remember the course where we had to simulate taking the company public and how you build those financial statements and position that company. And I thought those really built a great core around the financial underpinnings of a business.\n\nI also took some courses that got more specialized around how to price debt securities and things like that. That's less applicable to a lot of things. You really don't need to understand that in the vast majority of roles, unless you’re really heading down a pure play Wall Street investor kind of track. \n\n**What would you advise for open-minded students who aren’t dead set on one path?**\n\nI would advise them to get the core of accounting and finance. But then also to pick up the core of marketing and sales and other functions. \n\nWhat I thought was nice about entrepreneurial management courses was you got to really apply that stuff. And so I loved learning the accounting and the finance and then going over the entrepreneurial management and having to write the business plan for my company. Which included putting together financials and then also a marketing plan and letting me apply that knowledge. This type of application helped me retain it, as opposed to taking highly specialized courses that are just less applicable unless you know what you want to do and which is tremendous.\n\nThe kind of experience that I had would make you a better product manager at Facebook, or management consultant, or business development person at Google, or wherever you wanted to go. The path that I took really applies to a wide variety of things. In most roles, you're trying to assess the business impact of things whether it's a new product or a partnership or you’re trying to sell something. \n\n**Was there a particular industry of interest when you first started?**\n\nNot really. Because of my summer experiences, I was hoping to get a role on Wall Street and in the investment banking capacity because there were very few spots of the time and it's changed a lot in 20 years. One of the things that I liked about this mindset was that I remained a generalist, so I got to work on a wide variety of industries and up-and-down the whole range of buying and selling companies, raising capital for and structuring companies.\n\n<div style=\"display:none\">\nIf I was advising someone, I would say: \n\n> ==Think about passionate, but also think about optionality. that are going to open doors for you and give you more choices.== \n\nA lot about career management is about creating choices for yourself.\n</div>\n\n**How did you navigate Log-Me-On.com without a solid core competency in technology?** \n\nSo growing up I had one of the first computers and dabbled in writing code. But I didn’t even consider computer science as a major or have any plans to be a technologist when I was underground. A lot of what technology is doing is trying real world problems. In my case, I stumbled across a problem I was having around usernames and passwords and then was able to go partner and bring the technical skills that I needed to try to solve that problem. I'm pretty active on the Penn Wharton Entrepreneurship Advisory Board, and we talk about what a great opportunity that the students have, to work on different projects in a cross-discipline manner.\n\nIt's rare that one person has all the skills. You can be a technology person, without being a technologist. But you better make sure that you've got some really talented engineers as partners.\n\n\n<div id=\"disrupt\"></div>\n**A lot of students who have an inclination towards technology, but not necessarily the technologist skills have insecurities towards pursuing tech industries. What advice do you have for them?**\n\nWhat’s interesting is that there used be a technology sector and there were tech companies and then other companies would literally outsource their technology. It was viewed of as a non-core thing. I think it's becoming increasingly hard to find any company that doesn't think technology is core to what they do. I think Goldman Sachs has more software engineers than most tech companies. \nThis is a good example of a company with traditional roots truly embracing technologies in the way they're going to compete in the future and not be disrupted. At least half the startups in Silicon Valley are trying to disrupt something. \n\n>==Students need to be curious about technology and how things work and what's possible.==\n\nThey don’t necessarily need to understand how to write software or what languages things are written.\n\n>==Learn to ask, \"How could friction be removed from this business or this process? How would you do this if you were to start from scratch and leveraging all the technology is possible?\"== \n\n<div id=\"rapid-prototype\"></div>\n**How can students think in the manner that you described without a core engineering degree? How do they identify these places for disruption when they lack an understanding of how the technology works in a fundamental manner?**\n\nIt's a really good question. I think doing projects can help. I know a lot of Wharton students are doing business plans and creating ventures and projects and things like that. If I was there today, I would partner with people in the computer science program, and work on something fun. \n\n\n>==You can build stuff quite inexpensively and you can learn a lot from this type of rapid prototyping.==\n\nStudents are growing up as digital natives, whereas lot of my peers were very late to get on the technology curve.\n\n<div id=\"attentive\"></div>\nI would encourage people to download lots of apps and really try to lean in and push yourself to be an early adopter of various technologies. You’ve got to think about, “Where is this stuff going? How can it be applied to problems that need to be solved?” Then, when you are considering internships and job searches, find places that are on the cutting edges as opposed to places that are about to be disrupted.\n\n**So Jeff Weiner from LinkedIn always championed that everyone should have a one-line life goal in terms of their career. His has always been to reform education. What would yours be?**\n\nSo I know Jeff and I used to work for him. He's really one of the incredible success stories that I know. I don't really have a one-liner like that. My career has been about working with great people in an environment where I feel that I can add value to create more opportunities for myself as well as the company. I know an executive coach that always says,\n\n>==\"Find your purpose as opposed to your passion,\"==\n\nwhich really resonated with me.\n\nI think people have to be little bit careful. I've largely ended up in the music industry in my current role. The music industry isn’t just for people who love music. Loving music doesn't necessarily lead to a career full of purpose and meet some of the other criteria I just mentioned. \n\n**What is something funny or interesting about your career?**\n\nSo I started out in finance, assuming that I would be an investment banker. Maybe turn into an investor. Just generally stay in Wall Street. Then I had a wild idea on a plane one night, and next thing you know, I’m an Internet guy. I take a role, and next thing you know I’ve worked for a company that’s primarily associated with music. Now, I’m on the Billboard's Power 100 List of executives in the music industry. Definitely not something I ever thought I would be on.\n\nBut I loved it. Diversity: OK! Wall Street: Awesome, OK. Internet: Amazing, wow! Music industry: so interesting!\n\nAnd then right now I'm producing a TV show with Mark Burnett and Jamie Foxx as the host and it's called \"Beat Shazam\" and it's going to be on every Thursday night this summer.\n\nI'm spending a lot of time on that right now but I'm an executive producer of the show, with Mark Burnett, who is a legend. If you'd asked me when I was undergrad, “Do you think you'll ever produce a TV show?” I’m not sure if I would have known how to answer the question. But it's awesome. \n\nBut to your point about being open-minded, \n>==You’ve got to create options for yourself and follow your instinct. Then, get ready for an exciting career journey into doing things that you never thought you’d end up doing.==\n\nAlso, feel free to [email in](mailto:writers+rich@thesign.al) any followup questions.

Do it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>After spending a few years at investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (DLJ), Rich Riley stumbled upon an internet problem and decided to build out Log-Me-On.com. It was subsequently acquired by Yahoo, and Rich tagged along for a 13-year stretch, during which he got to experience London and Geneva to work as the Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Yahoo Europe, Middle East and Africa, and eventually switching back to become Executive Vice President, Americas, Yahoo’s largest department. When Rich left Yahoo, he wanted to fill the role of CEO at a company he could really get involved in. Fortunately, Shazam found him and it was love at first sight, and he has been CEO of Shazam for four years and counting.</p>\n\n<p>Rich graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 1996, majoring in Finance and Entrepreneurial Management.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>What was the path that you took leading up to your first venture?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I chose Wharton over several other Ivy League schools for the incredible business education. I was very eager to learn from the best and get to Wall Street and thought Wharton that was the best place to do that.</p>\n\n<p>I have always been an entrepreneur. In high school, there was lots of yards and so I had a lawn mowing company. I was always thinking about entrepreneurial ventures, which led to a dual concentration in finance and entrepreneurial management at Wharton. I really enjoyed my work and the entrepreneurial management courses, where the professors brought in real world examples and experiences into the classroom (<em>Editor’s Notes: MGMT 235: Management of Innovation and MGMT 264: Entrepreneurial Management are great courses that offer this type of exposure. See more <a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/teaching/undergraduate-entrepreneurial-paths/\">here</a></em>). I played football my first year and stopped after that. I was president of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and very active in that. </p>\n\n<p><strong>When did your entrepreneurial aspiration pick up?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A couple years [into investment banking], I was still working incredible hours but really enjoying it. I was traveling a lot for that role, and then on one airplane ride, I had an idea around organizing usernames and passwords. I asked a good friend of mine in the I.T. group at DLJ if there was a service that does what I was thinking. Keep in mind, this was 1998, so the Internet was really just getting started. To give you an idea, we were just starting to use e-mail as a core business tool. We were quick to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>“Why don't we create one?”</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With DLJ's blessing, we created a side project and built a service called Log-Me-On.com. The concept was that you would go to Log-Me-On.com, input all your usernames and passwords and this would be the place where you started your internet experience. You would go to Log-Me-On.com and click on the Wall Street Journal and it would automatically log you in. Now, you wouldn't need to always carry around all these usernames and passwords. We built this site, and we were promoting it very guerrilla style. We got thousands of users, and it was going fine. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you really start pushing Log-Me-On.com?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We didn’t want to go obsolete. We started asking questions like, “What if you didn't have to go to Log-Me-on.com? What if we were just in the browser?” My friend's brother is an incredibly talented software developer and he figured out how to make something persistent in the browser. At the time, Netscape and Internet Explorer were the two primary browsers. No one had ever done what he figured out, and we quickly realized that we needed to protect this intellectual property. We went and got the best intellectual property attorney that we could get, without much of a budget, and filed a patent on the technology. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Where did you decide to take the technology?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We decided this technology would best be used on a big platform. There were three big Internet companies at the time: Yahoo, Excite, and Lycos. We created mockup toolbars for each and leveraging my network, we were able to get Jerry Yang at Yahoo and George Bell at Excite both interested. Both placed bids for the company, and in the end, we sold it to Yahoo. There were four of us working on the company at the time, and we all moved out to California. In 1999, I joined as the 799th employee of Yahoo in their corporate development group in California.</p>\n\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: To reiterate, Rich ended up having a 13-year run at Yahoo. He was there for a lot of dotcom boom and the bust. He attributed his loyalty to the fact that Jerry Yang believed in them. It was a fast-pace environment that kept giving him more responsibility.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Your biggest takeaway from Penn?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One is the opportunities that I had coming out of Penn were tremendous. You really get catapulted into great roles at great companies that really get your career off to a fast start. I look at a lot of my classmates that have gone on to do really amazing things from that sort of launch pad. I also think that having some of the background that you get at Wharton around finance, modeling, and really understanding the core economics of any business. How business really works and how financial statements come together are thing that are harder to pick up later.</p>\n\n<p>Having the entrepreneurial management training and seeing lots of real world examples, dealing with a lot of case studies, really hones your instincts at a young age. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Going off of your comment about the core skill set, how do you choose between breadth versus depth in different topic areas?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The core is the most important part. Understanding the fundamentals of accounting and of corporate finance. I remember the course where we had to simulate taking the company public and how you build those financial statements and position that company. And I thought those really built a great core around the financial underpinnings of a business.</p>\n\n<p>I also took some courses that got more specialized around how to price debt securities and things like that. That's less applicable to a lot of things. You really don't need to understand that in the vast majority of roles, unless you’re really heading down a pure play Wall Street investor kind of track. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What would you advise for open-minded students who aren’t dead set on one path?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I would advise them to get the core of accounting and finance. But then also to pick up the core of marketing and sales and other functions. </p>\n\n<p>What I thought was nice about entrepreneurial management courses was you got to really apply that stuff. And so I loved learning the accounting and the finance and then going over the entrepreneurial management and having to write the business plan for my company. Which included putting together financials and then also a marketing plan and letting me apply that knowledge. This type of application helped me retain it, as opposed to taking highly specialized courses that are just less applicable unless you know what you want to do and which is tremendous.</p>\n\n<p>The kind of experience that I had would make you a better product manager at Facebook, or management consultant, or business development person at Google, or wherever you wanted to go. The path that I took really applies to a wide variety of things. In most roles, you're trying to assess the business impact of things whether it's a new product or a partnership or you’re trying to sell something. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Was there a particular industry of interest when you first started?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not really. Because of my summer experiences, I was hoping to get a role on Wall Street and in the investment banking capacity because there were very few spots of the time and it's changed a lot in 20 years. One of the things that I liked about this mindset was that I remained a generalist, so I got to work on a wide variety of industries and up-and-down the whole range of buying and selling companies, raising capital for and structuring companies.</p>\n\n<div style=\"display:none\">  \nIf I was advising someone, I would say: \n\n> <mark>Think about passionate, but also think about optionality. that are going to open doors for you and give you more choices.</mark> \n\nA lot about career management is about creating choices for yourself.  \n</div>\n\n<p><strong>How did you navigate Log-Me-On.com without a solid core competency in technology?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>So growing up I had one of the first computers and dabbled in writing code. But I didn’t even consider computer science as a major or have any plans to be a technologist when I was underground. A lot of what technology is doing is trying real world problems. In my case, I stumbled across a problem I was having around usernames and passwords and then was able to go partner and bring the technical skills that I needed to try to solve that problem. I'm pretty active on the Penn Wharton Entrepreneurship Advisory Board, and we talk about what a great opportunity that the students have, to work on different projects in a cross-discipline manner.</p>\n\n<p>It's rare that one person has all the skills. You can be a technology person, without being a technologist. But you better make sure that you've got some really talented engineers as partners.</p>\n\n<div id=\"disrupt\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>A lot of students who have an inclination towards technology, but not necessarily the technologist skills have insecurities towards pursuing tech industries. What advice do you have for them?</strong></p>\n\n<p>What’s interesting is that there used be a technology sector and there were tech companies and then other companies would literally outsource their technology. It was viewed of as a non-core thing. I think it's becoming increasingly hard to find any company that doesn't think technology is core to what they do. I think Goldman Sachs has more software engineers than most tech companies. <br />\nThis is a good example of a company with traditional roots truly embracing technologies in the way they're going to compete in the future and not be disrupted. At least half the startups in Silicon Valley are trying to disrupt something. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>Students need to be curious about technology and how things work and what's possible.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They don’t necessarily need to understand how to write software or what languages things are written.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>Learn to ask, \"How could friction be removed from this business or this process? How would you do this if you were to start from scratch and leveraging all the technology is possible?\"</mark> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div id=\"rapid-prototype\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>How can students think in the manner that you described without a core engineering degree? How do they identify these places for disruption when they lack an understanding of how the technology works in a fundamental manner?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It's a really good question. I think doing projects can help. I know a lot of Wharton students are doing business plans and creating ventures and projects and things like that. If I was there today, I would partner with people in the computer science program, and work on something fun. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>You can build stuff quite inexpensively and you can learn a lot from this type of rapid prototyping.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Students are growing up as digital natives, whereas lot of my peers were very late to get on the technology curve.</p>\n\n<div id=\"attentive\"></div>  \n\n<p>I would encourage people to download lots of apps and really try to lean in and push yourself to be an early adopter of various technologies. You’ve got to think about, “Where is this stuff going? How can it be applied to problems that need to be solved?” Then, when you are considering internships and job searches, find places that are on the cutting edges as opposed to places that are about to be disrupted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So Jeff Weiner from LinkedIn always championed that everyone should have a one-line life goal in terms of their career. His has always been to reform education. What would yours be?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I know Jeff and I used to work for him. He's really one of the incredible success stories that I know. I don't really have a one-liner like that. My career has been about working with great people in an environment where I feel that I can add value to create more opportunities for myself as well as the company. I know an executive coach that always says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>\"Find your purpose as opposed to your passion,\"</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which really resonated with me.</p>\n\n<p>I think people have to be little bit careful. I've largely ended up in the music industry in my current role. The music industry isn’t just for people who love music. Loving music doesn't necessarily lead to a career full of purpose and meet some of the other criteria I just mentioned. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is something funny or interesting about your career?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So I started out in finance, assuming that I would be an investment banker. Maybe turn into an investor. Just generally stay in Wall Street. Then I had a wild idea on a plane one night, and next thing you know, I’m an Internet guy. I take a role, and next thing you know I’ve worked for a company that’s primarily associated with music. Now, I’m on the Billboard's Power 100 List of executives in the music industry. Definitely not something I ever thought I would be on.</p>\n\n<p>But I loved it. Diversity: OK! Wall Street: Awesome, OK. Internet: Amazing, wow! Music industry: so interesting!</p>\n\n<p>And then right now I'm producing a TV show with Mark Burnett and Jamie Foxx as the host and it's called \"Beat Shazam\" and it's going to be on every Thursday night this summer.</p>\n\n<p>I'm spending a lot of time on that right now but I'm an executive producer of the show, with Mark Burnett, who is a legend. If you'd asked me when I was undergrad, “Do you think you'll ever produce a TV show?” I’m not sure if I would have known how to answer the question. But it's awesome. </p>\n\n<p>But to your point about being open-minded,  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>You’ve got to create options for yourself and follow your instinct. Then, get ready for an exciting career journey into doing things that you never thought you’d end up doing.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:writers+rich@thesign.al\">email in</a> any followup questions.

[The biggest thing that's changed about tech companies](#tech-companies) is that tech has gone from its own little world to something that is played out on a much bigger stage. \n3. [Managing your own psychology](#psychology) is an overlooked skill when starting a company.\n\nAfter spending time at law school, David Tisch began working at [TechStars](http://www.techstars.com/) in New York. He is now the managing director of [BoxGroup](http://boxgroup.com/), which has invested early stage in companies like GroupMe, Trello, Stripe, and Warby Parker, and is the co-founder and chairman of [Spring](https://www.shopspring.com/). David's patience and prescience are likely what makes him a valuable partner to promising startups around the world.\n\nDavid graduated in 2003 from the University of Pennsylvania after studying American History. He went on to complete a law degree at the New York University School of Law in 2006.\n\n---\n\n**You sold baseball cards as a kid; one of the first things that come to mind is, why baseball cards?**\n\nI am a big sports fan. And I think there were some things inherent in sports and specifically sports cards that I loved, one of which is you get to memorize and learn a ton of information. The other thing is that it involved predicting. You were looking to buy things that were undervalued and sell them for more value. And so that was super attractive to the way that my mind was looking for the undiscovered. Back then that was rookies in baseball cards, and today that's startups. That's my passion.\n\n**What were your plans when you left Penn?** \n\nI didn't want to go into finance. And I thought law school was probably the best alternative.  I was sort of pushing off figuring out what I wanted to do, and I thought law school was an interesting way to learn a certain problem-solving framework.\n\n**You said you didn't want to go into finance. I'm interested in why.** \n\nMy father is in finance. I guess I was rebelling more than anything. I think intellectually it wasn't a thing that I found stimulating at a university level. Maybe I was just too young to sort of appreciate it but it wasn't the path that I felt like I wanted to go down.\n\n<div id=\"confident\"></div>\n**Were you comfortable with the uncertainty of making a career choice outside the mainstream?** \n\nI don't think anybody's ever comfortable with uncertainty. It's a unique set of people who enjoy that. The challenge with graduating college is you're surrounded by very ambitious people a lot of the time and there's pressure to have an answer to what you're doing next. \n\nComing out of college if you don't have all those answers it really does create a significant amount of insecurity. ~~I think ~~that's sort of natural and I think it's hard to avoid. People that come off as more confident all the time are just better at acting than you are. \n\n**Were you a good actor — did you seem confident to your friends, like you were going to law school for a reason?**\n\nEverybody tries to put their best foot forward and seem comfortable. It's hard to show vulnerability. Was I confident at age 22 about law school? I was uncertain. I don't know if I shared that openly or if I didn't share it but I was excited because I had a plan more than anything. When you stay in school and you know what the next two years are bringing, there's some semblance of safety there.\n\n\n**Looking back at Penn, what would you say is a very fond memory that you hold?**\n\nThe biggest thing I took away from college was amazing friends, life-long friends that fifteen years later are incredibly close. I think that's priceless. \n\n**What do you think about students jumping into the workforce right after their freshman year of college and doing a finance or consulting internship?**\n\nI'm probably too old to really understand - the world changed a lot in terms of when and how people are getting internships in general. To me, the more exposure you get in the years that you haven't figured out what you want to do when you grow up, the better.\n\n**So when you finished school, what did that feel like and what was your next step in your plan?**\n\nI did almost drop out after my first semester because I didn't want to be a lawyer. I decided to stick it through and pass the bar exam. I felt relief. I was very scared to fail the bar exam - everybody is - and I think passing it completed my law school journey.\n\nThat was a huge sense of relief and then back to uncertainty because I didn't want to be a lawyer, so I needed to figure out what to do. I spent time looking at a wide array of different industries to go work in, and I ended up working in real estate finance. That was not the plan going in, just something opportunistic that I thought would make sense.\n\n**How did you join TechStars?** \n\nI joined TechStars in 2009. I did a couple angel investments and I was lucky enough to meet David Cohen, who started TechStars, and I introduced myself and asked him a lot of questions because I was really impressed by the organization. I just sort of dove in and started asking question after question, and one of them was why they weren't in New York at the time. And about six weeks later after a series of interviews and conversation, I was lucky enough to join the organization and spend 3 great years there.\n\n<div id=\"tech-companies\"></div>\n**Having been around the internet in 2006 and being around it now, what do you think has changed about the landscape of internet companies?** \n\nI think the biggest thing that's changed is that tech has gone from its own little world to something that is played out on a much bigger stage. Startups are something that very few people did back in 2003 to 2010. It wasn't the cool thing to do. Now startups are taught in schools and people are looking at starting companies as a career option and entrepreneurship, in general, has become much bigger and that's because tech affects so many more people. Everyone has a smartphone and people feel the impact that technology can have and that's a pretty awesome shift in the world but it definitely means more people are doing it. I think back then it was a bit quieter.\n\n**What do you think this means for this generation's talent and schools? If you could go back to Penn now, what would you study and why?** \n\nIf I could go back to Penn now I would study computer science. I think just having a basic education in computer science is some magical tool and I wish I could have learned to code throughout that whole part of my life.\n\n**How did BoxGroup end up starting?** \n\nI was introduced to a company by a lawyer friend of mine and I'd never made an investment before. I explored the legal and structural ways to make an investment work. And I started an LLC called BoxGroup to invest in the company.\n\nI thought that was going to be the only investment I was going to make from that vehicle.\n\n**A lot of students want to move out to San Francisco because they think that's the epicenter of technology. How is working in the New York technology sector?**\n\nSan Francisco is definitely the home of the industry. That's not something you can argue. I think that great companies can be created anywhere where there's enough talent to try to build and scale a company and that as technology penetrates more and more industries, that it benefits other cities as well. My home is in New York, I'm from New York, and this is where I'm going to spend my life. So it's important to me to be part of this ecosystem more than any other. \n\n\n**What is a book and movie recommendation you have?**\n\nI've never missed an episode of Survivor in my life. 34 seasons I think. But I have a strong passion for the show. I think we're a cult group. And if you want to read a book about startups and entrepreneurship I think Ben Horowitz's book, *The Hard Thing About Hard Things*, probably is the most interesting one to read. It tries to paint you an authentic picture about how challenging starting a company is.\n\n<div id=\"psychology\"></div>\n**In *The Hard Thing About Hard Things*, Ben says managing your own psychology is an overlooked skill when starting a company. I’m wondering how you’ve seen founders approach that at BoxGroup or Spring.** \n\nIt is vital to find the things that individually will allow you to stay sane. I think what you're doing when you start a company is totally crazy but there's no universal answer there. It's a combination of what you as an individual have around you and what you need to satisfy you.\n\nThat means having a strong support group, finding those unique things that keep you calm, whether that's exercising, reading, some sort of outdoor activity, and finding a way to keep your head as you go through this rollercoaster are vital.\n\n---\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

That was not the plan going in, just something opportunistic that I thought would make sense.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you join TechStars?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I joined TechStars in 2009. I did a couple angel investments and I was lucky enough to meet David Cohen, who started TechStars, and I introduced myself and asked him a lot of questions because I was really impressed by the organization. I just sort of dove in and started asking question after question, and one of them was why they weren't in New York at the time. And about six weeks later after a series of interviews and conversation, I was lucky enough to join the organization and spend 3 great years there.</p>\n\n<div id=\"tech-companies\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>Having been around the internet in 2006 and being around it now, what do you think has changed about the landscape of internet companies?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I think the biggest thing that's changed is that tech has gone from its own little world to something that is played out on a much bigger stage. Startups are something that very few people did back in 2003 to 2010. It wasn't the cool thing to do. Now startups are taught in schools and people are looking at starting companies as a career option and entrepreneurship, in general, has become much bigger and that's because tech affects so many more people. Everyone has a smartphone and people feel the impact that technology can have and that's a pretty awesome shift in the world but it definitely means more people are doing it. I think back then it was a bit quieter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do you think this means for this generation's talent and schools? If you could go back to Penn now, what would you study and why?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>If I could go back to Penn now I would study computer science. I think just having a basic education in computer science is some magical tool and I wish I could have learned to code throughout that whole part of my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did BoxGroup end up starting?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I was introduced to a company by a lawyer friend of mine and I'd never made an investment before. I explored the legal and structural ways to make an investment work. And I started an LLC called BoxGroup to invest in the company.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that was going to be the only investment I was going to make from that vehicle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A lot of students want to move out to San Francisco because they think that's the epicenter of technology. How is working in the New York technology sector?</strong></p>\n\n<p>San Francisco is definitely the home of the industry. That's not something you can argue. I think that great companies can be created anywhere where there's enough talent to try to build and scale a company and that as technology penetrates more and more industries, that it benefits other cities as well. My home is in New York, I'm from New York, and this is where I'm going to spend my life. So it's important to me to be part of this ecosystem more than any other. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a book and movie recommendation you have?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've never missed an episode of Survivor in my life. 34 seasons I think. But I have a strong passion for the show. I think we're a cult group. And if you want to read a book about startups and entrepreneurship I think Ben Horowitz's book, <em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</em>, probably is the most interesting one to read. It tries to paint you an authentic picture about how challenging starting a company is.</p>\n\n<div id=\"psychology\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>In <em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</em>, Ben says managing your own psychology is an overlooked skill when starting a company. I’m wondering how you’ve seen founders approach that at BoxGroup or Spring.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>It is vital to find the things that individually will allow you to stay sane. I think what you're doing when you start a company is totally crazy but there's no universal answer there. It's a combination of what you as an individual have around you and what you need to satisfy you.</p>\n\n<p>That means having a strong support group, finding those unique things that keep you calm, whether that's exercising, reading, some sort of outdoor activity, and finding a way to keep your head as you go through this rollercoaster are vital.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee. They do not represent BoxGroup, Spring, or any of the other individuals or institutions named above.</p>",

Right after college, he moved to San Francisco to join the only startup that recruited at Penn, Snapfish. There, he did finance and worked on its acquisition by Hewlett-Packard. \n\nHe currently works at Facebook as a product manager, but he previously worked on two startups: Betable, an online gambling startup that led him to live in London, and [Locality](https://locality.com/), a service that allows you to search and compare local businesses.

I thought it was a great step to get both the engineering and computer science knowledge and some business acumen as well. \n\n**Any clubs or work you did during college that you found was really interesting or helped you grow a lot?** \n \nI had a senior thesis on information security that had nothing to do with what I do now, but I think it's really just learning to think in different ways. I've always been on the business side of startups, but having the engineering knowledge helps you communicate with engineers and understand the scope and complexity of technical challenges in a project without having to consult other people. \n \n**How did having the engineering background teach you to approach problems differently?** \n \nI approach everything with a very engineering or systems-based approach. It's useful in tech and a lot of different jobs, but it's *not* the only thing that you need. Penn prepared me well on the engineering, technical, and business skills. But, there are a lot of **soft skills**, social skills, like knowing how to sell. Those are skills that a lot of universities shy away from. Nobody wants to be known as a salesperson or someone who cold calls. But those are skills that are very useful in almost anything else you do ([more here]()). \n<div id=\"sell\"></div>\nI was a CEO of a start-up, and I *sold* smart people to try to join me as employees, I *sold* investors to try to get money, I *sold* partners to work with us when we were too small to really make a difference to their bottom line. A lot of entrepreneurship is just selling stuff. It's something that you have to learn on your own.\n<div id=\"1\"></div> \n**A lot of us don't know where we're going or we feel pressure from our parents or peers. What would you say to someone trying to figure out their path?** \n \nI think a good start is to find your strengths. This is something Facebook says, and I totally agree with it:\n >==*Our strengths are things that you find joy and energy doing.*== \n\nIt might not necessarily be the things that you are actually best at. You might be really good at cranking Excel, but you may find that it's draining and you don't actually enjoy it. Maybe there are other things, like programming or data analysis, where you're like, “I'm actually in-flow. I don't feel tired because I want to do it.”\n \nAlso seek out [career counseling](www.upenn.edu/careerservices/). I feel like Wharton only teaches you so much, and doesn't really tell you anything about careers other than 80 percent of people go into financial or consulting. \n\n>==*I wish I knew exactly what I was getting into, what the job would entail, what I’d learn, what the earning potential was. You can really can get this information from talking to [anyone 25 or older in these industries](https://quakernet.alumni.upenn.edu/).*==\n\nI joined the *one* startup that recruited at Penn that year ([Snapfish](www.snapfish.com/)). I could have been more proactive about learning the type of role and the type of company I'm most interested in. \n<div id =\"summer\"></div> \nPeople now are getting relevant business experience significantly earlier than I did. \n>==*My first summer in college, I was waiting tables at a Mexican restaurant. The next one I was selling cell phones at AT&T. It didn't even occur to me that I needed to learn about all these industries that early.*==\n \n**What do you think you learned at Snapfish, since that was right after you graduated college?**\n\nI think there's a lot of just maturity and polish. I don't want to say it's one specific thing, just like if you take the same smart person when they're 20, 27, 32. The core's the same, the intelligence is there, the attitude is similar, but everything just gets a bit better. \n>==*The way that you communicate gets better, your critical thinking gets better, your confidence in your opinions and what you're supposed to do gets better. Being in as many different environments as possible helps that out.*== \n\n**So you worked at a startup in San Francisco and later founded a startup in New York. Could you talk about the differences in the startup culture between those cities?**\n \nThere are many. After Penn, I went straight to San Francisco to work for a startup called Snapfish. At the time, only a couple of kids my year actually went to SF. Everyone did consulting or finance and moved to New York — it's just what everyone did. So I was very excited to try it. \n\nFor early stage tech, NY tech is growing very fast, but it's still a significantly smaller market size than San Francisco. In San Francisco, you just have more access to networks of everything: more smart engineers, angel investors and venture capitalists, experienced people that could be advisors, mentors, or board members. It's a better place to learn and grow. \n \n>==*So if I were to start a company with no other knowledge, I'd probably say San Francisco, but it's balanced against the fact that New York may be a more interesting place to live.*== \n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n**What made you go to London and do you recommend that people get experience abroad?** \n \nI moved overseas for an online gambling startup because, legally, an executive of the company had to be based offshore to get an online gambling license outside the US. The startup scene there is much smaller. Before I moved to London, I spent six years in San Francisco, and it was the only place I knew as an adult. \n>==*I was really scared of moving out of the country. **It ended up being one of the best years of my life.** I knew I should have totally done this, that I should have done [study abroad](global.upenn.edu/pennabroad). I'm very bullish on it from a personal growth experience.*==\n \nI was scared that I would miss out on stuff in San Francisco, but the truth is, there's not much you're missing out. Moving to another place stretches you and enables you to make new friends, but it doesn't mean your old friends go away. So I highly encourage it as a personal growth experience. \n<div id=\"3\"></div> \n**So after London and after working on that startup, what led you to start [Locality](https://locality.com/)?** \n \nI finally just decided it was time to do it. Looking back, I would probably have done it sooner. There are certainly things that you learn at companies — not to discount that. But there's just so much more you learn about entrepreneurship through actually doing it. Like, the first time you realize, “I can't make payroll,\" and I have to tell my employees they're not getting paid. I had multiple situations being a week away from telling our employees that we're running out of money, and you always end up raising money right at the last second. \n \nSo I would say don't overvalue prior experience. If you feel like you have a good idea and you're excited to test it out, you don't need ten years of experience to do a startup. \n \n**Through your experience of running Locality what was most exciting about it, and what did you gain most from doing the startup?** \n \nYou get to learn all the different challenges at each stage of the business. It develops your self-confidence by putting you in stressful situations, forcing you to present to people. You have to develop huge confidence without freaking out or over-worrying. \n \nFunctionally it just forces you to think very methodically; there's a startup way of thinking that is different from a big company. At a startup, you are under-resourced, so you have to be very selective about what you do. What's the minimal amount of work that you can do, the smallest thing you can build that gives you *signal* on whether it's the right path or not? \n\n*Read on for Jay's advice on convincing, his move to Facebook, and his favorite blog and news sites.

I wasn't that far off from the DNA that matriculating Wharton students have, working in fields like finance or engineering or consulting. I got to Wharton and I think I could have carried on in financial services, and certainly with all the companies that populate Career Services it was really easy to do that. But I just knew that the beauty of this degree was that I could shift into another industry. \n \nIf you fast forward through my four years of investment banking between undergrad and Wharton, I had a great time. In some respects I still use that investment banking experience because of all the problem solving and the analytical skills that were required to work on the businesses that I did. But in the end, coming out of business school I said to myself now’s the time to apply all of the work experience, all the thinking to an industry that I really love—and that is media and film and television.\n \n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n**<h7>Some people choose investment banking because they don't know what they currently like and they think doing two or three years of it will open up doors. Was that true for you?</h7>**\n \nIt was definitely hard. Wharton has come so far since I graduated—I’m Wharton grad ’92 so I'm about to get on a plane and come back for our 25th reunion. We didn't have the resources, the alumni…Wharton’s really made inroads in the field of entertainment through the [LA WIEP trip](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep/), the West Coast campus, and the commitments to developing relationships here. I didn't have any of that. I felt like it was truly an independent job search, and my summer internship at an independent film company came through resources that had nothing to do with Wharton. The internship and the MBA did open some doors, but the way that I ended up in the industry was extremely nontraditional. \n\nMy second year on campus we had a speaker come named Bill Clinton who was a governor from Arkansas running for president. And I went to that—and that’s the great thing about Penn and Wharton: the speakers that we have are amazing and they're there every week from every sector of the economy and society. So I thought, wow this is something that I'm interested in – public policy!  I even took public policy classes when I was at Wharton. Later, I was back on the West Coast doing my entertainment job search when I was invited to a reception. There, I was introduced to a figure in the Democratic Party and was offered a job after graduation to work on [Clinton’s] campaign.\n \nBy graduation, I accepted the job on the Clinton campaign, and little did I know, I started to meet people on the campaign that had ties to Hollywood - which is kind of crazy. Now I realize that Washington and Hollywood are kind of sister cities. They both are one-company towns and both have a lot of entertainment companies and personalities that have connections to political candidates or parties. It was really fruitful for me to start meeting people through the campaign that had ties to Hollywood. Long story short, it got me a lot more interviews and I started at MGM Studios one week after the ’92 election. \n \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BstdgUB.jpg\n\" alt=\"MGM Studios\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%\">*<p align=\"center\">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) is most known for The Wizard of Oz, Singin' in the Rain, and several James Bond movies. Source: MGM Studios.</p>*\n\n**<h7>That’s crazy that you deliberately chose the policy route first but it still led you to media.</h7>**\n \nYeah. And you know I'm not so sure Career Services would be happy with me. Or even my parents—when they arrived at graduation and we were going to these little parties and receptions, they were like, “Why is my son going to work for a stipend on a political campaign when all his friends are taking big banking jobs?” It was just part and parcel of a nontraditional career. I worked at a company that has tripled in size in the six years that I've been here at Lionsgate. And I think we just started going on campus for visits. It's just a different timeline, a different landscape for how talent comes into the industry. \n \n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n**<h7>Hopefully as more Penn alumni start going to these industries, Career Services will feel more of a pressure to bring these companies over to recruit.</h7>**\n \nI just want to make a note about that. I think that there might be a perception here in Hollywood that if somebody’s going to Wharton, whether it is undergrad or grad, they're one-dimensional – like they’re finance wonks. We hosted the Wharton crew recently [from the WIEP trip] and we gave them a case about television distribution. The whole challenge was to come into Lionsgate and demonstrate a sales pitch for a specific network. \n \nWhen I saw the groups of students get up and talk so eloquently about why they were recommending a given portfolio of films they picked, I thought to myself, \n\n>==This is so much more than a group of finance students. They're worldly, they're international, they have stories to tell, and some of them have creative sides.==\n \nThat's a challenge on the business schools to say that we not only have the best and the brightest but they're interesting and creative and progressive and have bright minds. So I just wanted to share that with you because that's one of the things that I think students have to break through as well. I still hear people say, wow I'm surprised you're on this side of the business, why aren't you a CFO? It’s a legacy that we have to carry in our Wharton backpacks - that we're the big finance school. \n \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vZWyJbm.png\n\" alt=\"Wharton Finance Careers\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\">*<p align=\"center\">Wharton has the 2nd highest percentage of graduates going into finance of all business schools.

I was nervous because much of my degree was financed through student loans. So I thought to myself, what am I doing? I did do some consulting interviews, but I just didn't have my full heart in the discussions with the recruiters. It was nothing like the passion I had for media. At the end of the day, I had some tough conversations with my parents along the lines of, you spent how much on this degree and you're doing what? \n \nAnd I think part of it was that the election had an end date. The campaign job was almost like a special project. It wasn't like I was going to work at a nonprofit. But I saw value in expanding my set of relationships so my parents finally came around. Then I got a job offer at MGM and it was a great offer in terms of fiber and content. It was an entry level studio salary so I did have roommates for the first year. But I think I flattened my student loans to make them more bearable or level. \n \nThat's the thing about entertainment—there's this [mail room mentality](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/magazine/why-are-harvard-graduates-in-the-mailroom.html) and the salaries coming out of undergrad and grad reflect it. I found that I had to work with that because my parents had no affiliation with the entertainment industry to help me out. I'm first generation American—my parents are from Hungary.  And they liked when I said to them in high school that I wanted to go to medical school. They were like, “Of course you do! That's what we expect of you!” I was salutatorian in my school, I got straight A’s, I got scholarships, I was doing what that first born immigrant child is supposed to do.

            "markdown": "\n</style>\nContinuation of [Part 1](http://www.thesign.al/lawrence-szabo-1) of Lawrence Szabo's Interview\n*Read time: 5 minutes*\n\n---\n<div id=\"4\"></div>\n**<h7>Do you have any advice for students here interested in media and entertainment?</h7>**\n \nPart of the rewards of this industry is that I’m using every part of my left brain and right brain. I work in film and television distribution; this is an interdisciplinary field and that is what’s so exciting to me. For example, we had Snapchat in here the other day who’s now having discussions with us on developing original content for them. So Snapchat users could watch a series that involves some sort of interactive component. All these emerging digital platforms want to tell stories in the way that their users are used to—holding a device or in short form that’s seven minutes or less. \n \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UYSh1cl.jpg\" alt=\"Power Rangers Movie Snapchat Filter\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%\">*<p align=\"center\">Liongate partnered with Snapchat for filters for the Power Rangers Movie premiere. Source: Youtube.</p>*\n\nWe have this meeting here at Lionsgate every Monday where the heads of every division get in a room and we talk about the weekend, about which movies performed well and which didn't and why. We have our production executives there and we also look at the whole worldwide industry. We just talked about the latest Fast and Furious movie that came out two weeks ago. In its opening weekend in China, it did just under $200 million. I believe as of today in one territory in China, the movie has made over $400 million! It’s so staggering that the Chinese market has become such a behemoth in terms of its appetite for Western content. It's incredible. \n \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/d0m9JGh.png\" alt=\"Film box-office revenues, China vs. US\" style=\"width:60%;height:6-%\">*<p align=\"center\">According to the [Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21674821-chinas-booming-film-market-tantalising-hard-crack-lost-shangywood), China's box-office revenues are expected to surpass that of the US by 2018.</p>*\n\nSo you think about all these things like technology, globalization, public versus private…that sort of thing is part of every week that I work here and it's fantastic. To be able to walk into this building and have someone hand me a script the way that they did yesterday—“Here’s a script about the Irish troubles in the 1970s that involved conflict between Britain and Ireland; read it and tell me what it’s worth.” That is the best thing that could ever happen! \n\n>==It’s like, here's a piece of content, read it and then postulate a business model for how we can make this content profitably. I just love that.==\n \n<div id=\"media-advice\"></div>\n**<h7>How does one even prepare for such an interdisciplinary job like that?</h7>**\n \nI don't think you can prepare for it. But what you should know is that the industry invites curious people. We just finished our recruiting for the summer—I have two MBA's coming. Last year I had one from Wharton, this year from NYU and USC and then I have an undergrad coming from Yale. And you know we were evaluating the whole package. The most important thing for me was a demonstrated curiosity for this industry. That is lengths beyond somebody who scored 780 or whatever a high score is in the GMAT. \n \nThe industry is unstructured. So what we need is people that are self-starters but also creative thinkers that have a foundation of analytical thinking. I personally looked for curiosity and passion. Because of what I just described about media being a highly interdisciplinary industry, somebody who's interested in so many different things is going to thrive here. And I don't think you can get all the right advice from one person so that's what I love about The Sign.al, in that there are different articles about different people at different stages of their careers. \n \nI have this religious thing that I do every Sunday where I go on a run or a hike and then I buy a Sunday New York Times. In the business section of the Times, there's this article on the second page called [The Corner Office](https://www.nytimes.com/column/corner-office). It's a short interview with a CEO and they ask some of these similar questions and get perspective. They have pharmaceutical CEO’s, they have people in the public sector, they have entrepreneurs that launched brands and companies. I love reading this article because people have a range of perspectives and I borrow them especially with regard to management style. At this stage in my career, I've become a coach and I'm running a division here. I'm really paying attention to how you motivate and rally a group of people around an objective. \n \nIn this case, I work for a commercial company. We have a business plan. We have to hit $330 million of revenue this year. So how do I manage this group of people towards that goal? I pick up things from this series of articles, and this is just my way of saying that I hope your readers read more than just the interview with Lawrence Szabo. \n>==There's a range of experience based on the skills that we have and it pays to really listen to a range of career paths and opinions.==\n \nThis year between Lionsgate and [Starz](https://www.starz.com/) we'll invest $1.8 billion in content across both sides of the company, the feature side and the TV series side. This is the most electric part of being a studio chief. There are only seven of these jobs [across the seven major studios] and you're tasked with deciding how to spend this $1.8 billion. \n\n<div id=\"5\"></div>\n**<h7>La La Land was one of Lionsgate's very first musicals. What was it like pitching that and seeing it come to life?</h7>**\n \nEvery studio is looking for that tentpole franchise that thrives in successive installments like the Hunger Games, which we made four movies of over the course of four years. The benefits that the big franchises deliver are that they allow studios to develop brand extensions. So Hunger Games has extended its monetizable brand into the interactive space with games, theme parks, and television. But beyond that, every studio has this, I’ll call it this for lack of a better word, “R&D budget” where they pick up truly original ideas that have low production cost with the possibility of high return. And that's the category of La La Land. \n \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bXPR4gc.jpg\" alt=\"La La Land\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\">*<p align=\"center\">La La Land is regarded as one of the best movies of 2016, winning 6 Academy Awards from a record-tying 14 nominations.

And then he said, hey I can't get this movie made about two artists and jazz, so I'm going to focus on another movie called Whiplash. He made Whiplash and it got nominated for five Oscars and J.K.

And the funny story with La La Land is that there was another studio that shall remain nameless.

I mean this is the way that projects take shape. The rest is history. \n\n---\n*Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

            "html": "<p></style> <br />\nContinuation of <a href=\"http://www.thesign.al/lawrence-szabo-1\">Part 1</a> of Lawrence Szabo's Interview <br />\n<em>Read time: 5 minutes</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div id=\"4\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong><h7>Do you have any advice for students here interested in media and entertainment?</h7></strong></p>\n\n<p>Part of the rewards of this industry is that I’m using every part of my left brain and right brain. I work in film and television distribution; this is an interdisciplinary field and that is what’s so exciting to me. For example, we had Snapchat in here the other day who’s now having discussions with us on developing original content for them. So Snapchat users could watch a series that involves some sort of interactive component. All these emerging digital platforms want to tell stories in the way that their users are used to—holding a device or in short form that’s seven minutes or less. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UYSh1cl.jpg\" alt=\"Power Rangers Movie Snapchat Filter\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%\"><em><p align=\"center\">Liongate partnered with Snapchat for filters for the Power Rangers Movie premiere. Source: Youtube.</p></em></p>\n\n<p>We have this meeting here at Lionsgate every Monday where the heads of every division get in a room and we talk about the weekend, about which movies performed well and which didn't and why. We have our production executives there and we also look at the whole worldwide industry. We just talked about the latest Fast and Furious movie that came out two weeks ago. In its opening weekend in China, it did just under $200 million. I believe as of today in one territory in China, the movie has made over $400 million! It’s so staggering that the Chinese market has become such a behemoth in terms of its appetite for Western content. It's incredible. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/d0m9JGh.png\" alt=\"Film box-office revenues, China vs. US\" style=\"width:60%;height:6-%\"><em><p align=\"center\">According to the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21674821-chinas-booming-film-market-tantalising-hard-crack-lost-shangywood\">Economist</a>, China's box-office revenues are expected to surpass that of the US by 2018.</p></em></p>\n\n<p>So you think about all these things like technology, globalization, public versus private…that sort of thing is part of every week that I work here and it's fantastic. To be able to walk into this building and have someone hand me a script the way that they did yesterday—“Here’s a script about the Irish troubles in the 1970s that involved conflict between Britain and Ireland; read it and tell me what it’s worth.” That is the best thing that could ever happen! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>It’s like, here's a piece of content, read it and then postulate a business model for how we can make this content profitably. I just love that.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div id=\"media-advice\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong><h7>How does one even prepare for such an interdisciplinary job like that?</h7></strong></p>\n\n<p>I don't think you can prepare for it. But what you should know is that the industry invites curious people. We just finished our recruiting for the summer—I have two MBA's coming. Last year I had one from Wharton, this year from NYU and USC and then I have an undergrad coming from Yale. And you know we were evaluating the whole package. The most important thing for me was a demonstrated curiosity for this industry. That is lengths beyond somebody who scored 780 or whatever a high score is in the GMAT. </p>\n\n<p>The industry is unstructured. So what we need is people that are self-starters but also creative thinkers that have a foundation of analytical thinking. I personally looked for curiosity and passion. Because of what I just described about media being a highly interdisciplinary industry, somebody who's interested in so many different things is going to thrive here. And I don't think you can get all the right advice from one person so that's what I love about The Sign.al, in that there are different articles about different people at different stages of their careers. </p>\n\n<p>I have this religious thing that I do every Sunday where I go on a run or a hike and then I buy a Sunday New York Times. In the business section of the Times, there's this article on the second page called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/corner-office\">The Corner Office</a>. It's a short interview with a CEO and they ask some of these similar questions and get perspective. They have pharmaceutical CEO’s, they have people in the public sector, they have entrepreneurs that launched brands and companies. I love reading this article because people have a range of perspectives and I borrow them especially with regard to management style. At this stage in my career, I've become a coach and I'm running a division here. I'm really paying attention to how you motivate and rally a group of people around an objective. </p>\n\n<p>In this case, I work for a commercial company. We have a business plan. We have to hit $330 million of revenue this year. So how do I manage this group of people towards that goal? I pick up things from this series of articles, and this is just my way of saying that I hope your readers read more than just the interview with Lawrence Szabo.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>There's a range of experience based on the skills that we have and it pays to really listen to a range of career paths and opinions.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This year between Lionsgate and <a href=\"https://www.starz.com/\">Starz</a> we'll invest $1.8 billion in content across both sides of the company, the feature side and the TV series side.

Far too often, students fail to take advantage of these testing grounds. Below are key tips for getting the most out of the experience. \n\n---\n<h4>Exercise the power of writing.</h4>\n \nFirst, take a few moments and write – publicly or privately – about your current mindset: Why are you doing this particular internship? What are you hoping to learn? What skills or previous experience are you going to leverage? Documenting these informal expectations will help you stay on track, especially when the workload picks up. \n\nCreate a few checkpoint dates for yourself throughout your internship to reflect or change these goals. Then, write some more. What is different from what you expected? Are you reaching your goal? Whenever times get rough, you can look back at these for motivation.\n \n<h4>People are walking libraries.</h4>\n \nNo matter what company you're at – S&P 500 giant or startup – around every corner desk sits someone itching to tell another bug-eyed youngster his or her story. I've accumulated lessons from Survivor contestants, nuclear power plant managers, and full-time mom-preneurs.\n \nUse your lunchtimes and coffee breaks wisely. Ask to eat with your mentor and his or her friends, or to connect you with another team of interest. As the new intern, you're analogous to the starving kid walking among countless rows of sampling tables at Costco. Brandish your suit of bravery and ask for a share - but don't be that annoying customer that buys nothing. It is *infinitely* more memorable if, prior to meeting coworkers, you’ve prepared well-composed research on them and their projects. Bonus points if you can make recommendations or offer help.\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HOmhNia.png\n\" alt=\"If Internet Explorer is brave enough to ask you to be your default browser, you're brave enough to ask that girl out.\" style=\"width:50%;height:50%\">*<p align=\"center\">Image source: Reddit.com.</p>*\n \nDuring such chats, learn about the interesting people they have worked with at the firm. If they are of interest, ask for an introduction and remind them during the follow-up \"Thank You\" email. If you forget to send the email, it's better late than never. Doing so will remind them of your enthusiasm, especially if you recall a memorable part of the conversation.\n \n<h4>Don't be invisible.</h4>\n \nThe worst thing that can happen to interns is to be forgotten by their team as to why they were there this summer. Don't stop asking questions, asking for more work, and making yourself known. After all, companies rarely need interns to do their work. The purpose is 95% to capture younger talent for full-time and 5% for coffee runs.\n \nAnd if coffee runs are all you're tasked to do, **be the best coffee runner in the world**. \n \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yiTMGgO.gif\" alt=\"Zootopia\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%\">*<p align=\"center\">Image source: Zootopia</p>*\n\nA fellow intern once kept a bowl of candy on her desk. She would make it a daily routine to ask passerbys who take a piece about their day. She soon became one of the most well-liked interns. \n\nAnother intern took the initiative to buy donuts for his team on days he knew were going to be rough. On hiring day, teams usually consider the intern's likability and quality of work alike. Small gestures like these can add up.\n<h4>Be a Learn-it-all, not a Know-it-all.</h4>\n \nLearn-it-alls > Know-it-alls any day. A company has no place for a self-proclaimed genius. As stated in Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, be curious and others will open up to you. The [Ben Franklin effect](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ben_Franklin_effect) shows that people build camaraderie and trust after giving advice more so than receiving it. Absorb everything at first, and then return the gesture once you've proven yourself.\n \n<h4>Take criticism. Be a big kid.</h4>\n \nOne of the biggest pieces of advice I've gotten is to treat your manager as a coach, not a grader. Don't take criticism personally, but rather as another perspective of your work. Every scathing review or outburst is another learning opportunity. That being said, if the reviews do cross the line, consult your mentor for an outside opinion. \n \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tuF6Ekf.jpg\" alt=\"Savage Chickens\" style=\"width:60%;height:60%\">*<p align=\"center\">Image source: Doug Savage</p>*\n\n<h4>The most welcoming group is often your school network.</h4>\n \nReach out to alumni who work at your company through LinkedIn or your school's alumni database (e.g. [Quakernet](https://quakernet-idp.alumni.upenn.edu/discovery/?entityID=https://quakernet-idp.alumni.upenn.edu/sp&return=https://quakernet-idp.alumni.upenn.edu/Shibboleth.sso/Login?SAMLDS=1&target=ss%253Amem%253Ace1c8bacd3846e21c8603f44cf3270fa9a084f9a63570ea11da433cbb85e55ae)). Email an introduction and ask for advice on how to succeed in this particular company, or how previous interns have impressed.\n \nFind groups of interns from your school that are located in the same area. Oftentimes, there are Facebook groups for company-specific or city-specific interns to organize meetups. Penn students can get access to [Penn in DC](https://piw.sas.upenn.edu/), Wharton in SF, among others.\n \n<h4>Work hard, play responsibly.</h4>\n \nPlease hold yourself under control at social events. Even though they are seemingly \"out of office,” you will still be evaluated for your actions. At one firm I worked at, an intern became incredibly intoxicated and proceeded to bet on himself in an eating competition. He wolfed down 30 tacos, won, threw up, and made everyone uncomfortable.\n \nHe got fired the next morning. Play responsibly.\n \n<h4>But do have fun.</h4>\n \nOutside of work, take time to destress and enjoy yourself. Don't get caught up in equating work to life; this is where you are most vulnerable to burnout. As stated by Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, burnout is the buildup of resentment at having to give up what truly matters. A 9 to 5 desk job can be a much different pace for a high-achieving, multifaceted student.\n \nChances are this internship is in a new city or hours away from your normal suburban life. Internships are not only a way to try out a company or job, but also a city. For those lacking a community, [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) is a great way to find common interest groups and fun events to attend.\n\nIn the end, **have a good time and try to learn something new**. You can't possibly do as poorly as this [intern](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/).\n \n---\n<h4>Additional Resources</h4>\n\n* [Best Ways to Excel in a Summer Internship](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-excel-in-a-summer-internship) - Quora\n* [How to Succeed at an Internship](https://medium.com/@Tapwage/how-to-succeed-at-an-internship-c33eec30a658) - Medium\n* [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) - Dale Carnegie\n* [How to Write Emails Like a CEO](https://medium.com/@Torbahax/how-to-write-emails-like-a-ceo-d6a2906611e0) - Medium\n* [Sheryl Sandberg on “Why We Have Too Few Women Leaders”](https://www.ted.com/talks/sheryl_sandberg_why_we_have_too_few_women_leaders) - TED **(HIGHLY recommended)**\n* [Satirical Drawings on Non-Threatening Leadership Strategies for Women](http://thecooperreview.com/non-threatening-leadership-strategies-for-women/) - The Cooper Review\n\n\n<a href=\"http://thesign.al/\"><button class=\"button2\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Home</span></button></a>\n\n",

I thought I wanted to be a theoretical physicist or mathematician and try to solve the great mysteries of the universe. Once I got to college I kept that interest, but computer science was already a field and it was getting hotter in the mid-1990s. And then I realized that more than just understanding reality, you can start creating realities here. On the pragmatic side, you started to see stories of people founding these great companies and doing well. \n\nThat was my first career out of college — I worked at Oracle and then I worked at a finance-related startup called [meVC](http://https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/08/feat2.html). It was going to democratize venture capital and I was the CTO at the ripe age of 22 years old. It grew to 40 people and I was the first employee there — the founders were two bankers who hired me. And then the NASDAQ popped, and it became survival mode. That day, I thought maybe I should apply to business school. \n\nAt the time, my thinking about business school was that clearly something is happening to the world and the economy, and I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life. I had this tech thing, but I found it somewhat emotionally traumatic because everyday is like a roller coaster. One day you're daydreaming about your future stock wealth, another day you're wondering if you’ll ever be able to buy a house.\n\nSo I thought business school would allow me to think more about what I want to do. I always had an interest being a broader generalist, but my resume definitely was pigeonholing me into CTO-type positions.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ac0Kq3jSsp4/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Khan Commencement Address\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\">*<p align=\"center\">Sal Khan delivering the Class Day address at Harvard Business School in 2014.</p>*\n\nI'd be lying if I didn't tell you part of my motivation was that I was very lonely and wanted a wife. I thought, school is a good place to meet people and figure out life. So I went to business school and I was exploring my options. I actually found the finance classes quite intriguing: it was this neat combination of math, economics, and human psychology. I got more and more interested in markets.\n\nThe second year, I took a capital markets class and my professor and I had a rapport. I asked him, “I really love this class, what can I do that is like this?” And he said, “You should go work at a hedge fund.” And I said, “That sounds great... what's a hedge fund?” If you ask someone what's a hedge fund, you will get many not-so-clear answers. \n\nI started asking around and I obviously had a lot of debt at that point so it looked like a really intriguing thing.\n\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div> \n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">I applied and probably got turned down from 40 different places. It was a horrible job market.</div>\n\nFor most of the people who want to go into hedge funds or private equity or these more selective financial careers, they have been building their resumes from the get go: they work at Goldman Sachs, and they get an internship at this private equity firm or this hedge fund. Mine looked nothing like that. I was getting a lot of inquiries from tech companies and even tech VC firms, but no one in the hedge fund world. But eventually there was this guy who was operating out of his house; his nascent hedge fund was starting to do well and he wanted to hire his first analyst. This was April of my second year when most of my peers had jobs already. I thought it'll at least get my foot in the door. \n\nI was lucky. Dan Wohl, my boss at Wohl Capital, was an incredible investor so I was able to learn a ton from him, not just on the financial or industry side, but also on how one should live their life. I was really enjoying that job, and I didn't view it as a temporary thing. When I was a year or two into it I was very happy and satisfied with where I was going, and based on Dan's investment acumen, we were doing well. But I had visions of one day starting a school. \n\n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">In college, I got rejected for the Rhodes Scholarship twice. Both times I told them: I want to get a Ph.D. in education because I'm interested in ways to reform education. They clearly didn't view my application as credible.</div>\n\n Even in the hedge fund world, I thought, if I could do really well over the next 10–15 years, I could retire and start a school on my own terms. That was always in the back of my mind, but I definitely didn't expect to stay there for a short amount of time. \n\n**You have a very technical background in your undergrad as well as the hedge fund analyst role. Did you feel your technical foundation helped you when you were creating and growing Khan Academy as an organization?**\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982286&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n\nYes and no. It's actually interesting that most people — based on my background and even stereotypes about Khan Academy — assume the analyst role must have been at a quantitative hedge fund, doing algorithmic trading. But it was actually the opposite: we were a qualitative hedge fund. I wanted to do that because while there was definitely a quantitative aspect to it in modeling an organization’s financials and making predictions, there was also a more human picture to it.\n\nMost of my day involved doing research on these companies, modeling and talking to their management teams to make sure I understood their business. Dan taught me to really listen closely and think about what is being said without it being said. Seeing when people are hesitant and what they choose to highlight, you can actually learn a lot about human psychology.\n\n<img src=\"https://bestreviewof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Khan.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Videos\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\">*<p align=\"center\">Sal making videos in the earlier days of the Academy.</p>*\n\nIn the Khan Academy world, in the early days I was making videos on math and science, so that's where my background helped a lot. I had an interest in those subjects and already had a strong view that most people weren't learning them in an intuitive way. Once Khan Academy started to get off the ground, I think the technical part was definitely important because for the early prototypes of the software on Khan Academy, I was coding stuff myself. \n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\nBut I also think the hedge fund background was important when it was time to decide what the structure of this organization should be. There were already VCs who were walking up and saying I'll write a check for this much right now, we could do a double bottom line organization and one day we can have some premium services, and this and that. But through my work in the hedge fund world I had become a student of capital structure. \n\n> <div style=\"font-size:21.6px\"> I've seen that no matter what the founder thinks he or she wants, at the end of the day, it is the owners or the stakeholders in the economic future of the entity that are, in the long term, going to decide what the entity becomes. </div>\n\nI didn't want to undermine that trust that people had in Khan Academy, and I didn't want it to change even after I was dead. I still dream that it's going to be around 500 years from now. \n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n**How did you go about deciding to leave your job and pursue Khan Academy full-time?**\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982801&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n\nIt's funny because I would always tell myself that I was relatively risk averse, but if you look at the arc of my career, even a two person hedge fund isn't most people's notions of stability. Compared to quitting my job, it was.\n\nI’ve thought a lot about this question when I was coming out of college and when I was thinking about doing Khan Academy full time. The more you put something out there and get evidence of strong product market fit and traction, and the more you can get that evidence while keeping your options open, the better. So if you are a Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates and you're in your dorm room in Harvard during sophomore year, you need a lot of evidence to convince yourself not just to leave a stable job, but to drop out of college. You shouldn't do that just from being inspired by some idea. Bill Gates had a contract with IBM, which was the tech company of the time, and Mark Zuckerberg clearly had this thing that was growing 10,000% a year with a lot of traction and no sign of stopping. So, if you hit on something like that, quit your job — you'd be nuts not to do it or at least to take some time off. \n\n<img src=\"https://media.glassdoor.com/l/452278/khan-academy-office.jpg\" alt=\"Khan Academy office\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\">*<p align=\"center\">Khan Academy now has over a hundred employees at its Mountain View office.</p>*\n\nBut that's not going to be the norm. I would tell most people, including a younger version of myself, that it is good to go to a more established place right out of college. It insulates your resume just as going to a good college is something people will never take away from you. If early on in your career, you have a Google, a Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, or a Khan Academy on your resume, people will know it. They'll have heard of it and they’ll know those companies only hire certain people. They'll also think you probably learned something interesting at those firms that you can bring it to their firm.\n\n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">The key is that if you do have an entrepreneurial desire long-term, don't let that atrophy.</div>\n\nOnce you're at five to six years in the industry, that's your first wave where you've learned a lot and it's not unreasonable to start thinking entrepreneurially. You're in your late 20s, you still don't have many mouths to feed and you kind of have a sense of how the world works. But even then, don't just do it on a whim.  Put something out there and prototype it. See if you can get some fit. \n\nI started tutoring my cousins in 2004, made videos in 2006, and I didn't quit my job until 2009 when there were already about 50,000 people who were using it. So it took me a while to make the plunge and even then it was super scary. There is a fun element to it: adventures are fun, but mostly in hindsight. When you don't know how it's going to end, it's incredibly stressful and scary. But one thing I did tell myself is that even if I have to go back to work in a traditional sense, I wasn't going to give up on this Khan Academy thing. So try to structure your endeavour in a way that it's kind of unkillable. \n\n**You mentioned that Dan Wohl was an important mentor for you. What are some of the key lessons that you learned from him in terms of your life principles and also from other important mentors that you had in your life?**\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982982&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n\nI’ve had a lot of great mentors. My first boss at Oracle was [Thomas Kurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kurian). He was a fairly young guy at the time; now he's the President of Product Development at Oracle. He was very clear in telling me not to get cynical.  It's very easy to get cynical, especially early in your life, and even more so coming out of college.

I thought I wanted to be a theoretical physicist or mathematician and try to solve the great mysteries of the universe. Once I got to college I kept that interest, but computer science was already a field and it was getting hotter in the mid-1990s. And then I realized that more than just understanding reality, you can start creating realities here. On the pragmatic side, you started to see stories of people founding these great companies and doing well. </p>\n\n<p>That was my first career out of college — I worked at Oracle and then I worked at a finance-related startup called <a href=\"http://https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/08/feat2.html\">meVC</a>. It was going to democratize venture capital and I was the CTO at the ripe age of 22 years old. It grew to 40 people and I was the first employee there — the founders were two bankers who hired me. And then the NASDAQ popped, and it became survival mode. That day, I thought maybe I should apply to business school. </p>\n\n<p>At the time, my thinking about business school was that clearly something is happening to the world and the economy, and I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life. I had this tech thing, but I found it somewhat emotionally traumatic because everyday is like a roller coaster. One day you're daydreaming about your future stock wealth, another day you're wondering if you’ll ever be able to buy a house.</p>\n\n<p>So I thought business school would allow me to think more about what I want to do. I always had an interest being a broader generalist, but my resume definitely was pigeonholing me into CTO-type positions.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ac0Kq3jSsp4/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Khan Commencement Address\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Sal Khan delivering the Class Day address at Harvard Business School in 2014.</p></em></p>\n\n<p>I'd be lying if I didn't tell you part of my motivation was that I was very lonely and wanted a wife. I thought, school is a good place to meet people and figure out life. So I went to business school and I was exploring my options. I actually found the finance classes quite intriguing: it was this neat combination of math, economics, and human psychology. I got more and more interested in markets.</p>\n\n<p>The second year, I took a capital markets class and my professor and I had a rapport. I asked him, “I really love this class, what can I do that is like this?” And he said, “You should go work at a hedge fund.” And I said, “That sounds great... what's a hedge fund?” If you ask someone what's a hedge fund, you will get many not-so-clear answers. </p>\n\n<p>I started asking around and I obviously had a lot of debt at that point so it looked like a really intriguing thing.</p>\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>  \n\n<blockquote>\n  <div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">I applied and probably got turned down from 40 different places. It was a horrible job market.</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For most of the people who want to go into hedge funds or private equity or these more selective financial careers, they have been building their resumes from the get go: they work at Goldman Sachs, and they get an internship at this private equity firm or this hedge fund. Mine looked nothing like that. I was getting a lot of inquiries from tech companies and even tech VC firms, but no one in the hedge fund world. But eventually there was this guy who was operating out of his house; his nascent hedge fund was starting to do well and he wanted to hire his first analyst. This was April of my second year when most of my peers had jobs already. I thought it'll at least get my foot in the door. </p>\n\n<p>I was lucky. Dan Wohl, my boss at Wohl Capital, was an incredible investor so I was able to learn a ton from him, not just on the financial or industry side, but also on how one should live their life. I was really enjoying that job, and I didn't view it as a temporary thing. When I was a year or two into it I was very happy and satisfied with where I was going, and based on Dan's investment acumen, we were doing well. But I had visions of one day starting a school. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">In college, I got rejected for the Rhodes Scholarship twice. Both times I told them: I want to get a Ph.D. in education because I'm interested in ways to reform education. They clearly didn't view my application as credible.</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even in the hedge fund world, I thought, if I could do really well over the next 10–15 years, I could retire and start a school on my own terms. That was always in the back of my mind, but I definitely didn't expect to stay there for a short amount of time. </p>\n\n<p><strong>You have a very technical background in your undergrad as well as the hedge fund analyst role. Did you feel your technical foundation helped you when you were creating and growing Khan Academy as an organization?</strong></p>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982286&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n\n<p>Yes and no. It's actually interesting that most people — based on my background and even stereotypes about Khan Academy — assume the analyst role must have been at a quantitative hedge fund, doing algorithmic trading. But it was actually the opposite: we were a qualitative hedge fund. I wanted to do that because while there was definitely a quantitative aspect to it in modeling an organization’s financials and making predictions, there was also a more human picture to it.</p>\n\n<p>Most of my day involved doing research on these companies, modeling and talking to their management teams to make sure I understood their business. Dan taught me to really listen closely and think about what is being said without it being said. Seeing when people are hesitant and what they choose to highlight, you can actually learn a lot about human psychology.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://bestreviewof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Khan.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Videos\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Sal making videos in the earlier days of the Academy.</p></em></p>\n\n<p>In the Khan Academy world, in the early days I was making videos on math and science, so that's where my background helped a lot. I had an interest in those subjects and already had a strong view that most people weren't learning them in an intuitive way. Once Khan Academy started to get off the ground, I think the technical part was definitely important because for the early prototypes of the software on Khan Academy, I was coding stuff myself. </p>\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>  \n\n<p>But I also think the hedge fund background was important when it was time to decide what the structure of this organization should be. There were already VCs who were walking up and saying I'll write a check for this much right now, we could do a double bottom line organization and one day we can have some premium services, and this and that. But through my work in the hedge fund world I had become a student of capital structure. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <div style=\"font-size:21.6px\"> I've seen that no matter what the founder thinks he or she wants, at the end of the day, it is the owners or the stakeholders in the economic future of the entity that are, in the long term, going to decide what the entity becomes. </div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn't want to undermine that trust that people had in Khan Academy, and I didn't want it to change even after I was dead. I still dream that it's going to be around 500 years from now. </p>\n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>  \n\n<p><strong>How did you go about deciding to leave your job and pursue Khan Academy full-time?</strong></p>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982801&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n\n<p>It's funny because I would always tell myself that I was relatively risk averse, but if you look at the arc of my career, even a two person hedge fund isn't most people's notions of stability. Compared to quitting my job, it was.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve thought a lot about this question when I was coming out of college and when I was thinking about doing Khan Academy full time. The more you put something out there and get evidence of strong product market fit and traction, and the more you can get that evidence while keeping your options open, the better. So if you are a Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates and you're in your dorm room in Harvard during sophomore year, you need a lot of evidence to convince yourself not just to leave a stable job, but to drop out of college. You shouldn't do that just from being inspired by some idea. Bill Gates had a contract with IBM, which was the tech company of the time, and Mark Zuckerberg clearly had this thing that was growing 10,000% a year with a lot of traction and no sign of stopping. So, if you hit on something like that, quit your job — you'd be nuts not to do it or at least to take some time off. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://media.glassdoor.com/l/452278/khan-academy-office.jpg\" alt=\"Khan Academy office\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Khan Academy now has over a hundred employees at its Mountain View office.</p></em></p>\n\n<p>But that's not going to be the norm. I would tell most people, including a younger version of myself, that it is good to go to a more established place right out of college. It insulates your resume just as going to a good college is something people will never take away from you. If early on in your career, you have a Google, a Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, or a Khan Academy on your resume, people will know it. They'll have heard of it and they’ll know those companies only hire certain people. They'll also think you probably learned something interesting at those firms that you can bring it to their firm.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">The key is that if you do have an entrepreneurial desire long-term, don't let that atrophy.</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once you're at five to six years in the industry, that's your first wave where you've learned a lot and it's not unreasonable to start thinking entrepreneurially. You're in your late 20s, you still don't have many mouths to feed and you kind of have a sense of how the world works. But even then, don't just do it on a whim.  Put something out there and prototype it. See if you can get some fit. </p>\n\n<p>I started tutoring my cousins in 2004, made videos in 2006, and I didn't quit my job until 2009 when there were already about 50,000 people who were using it. So it took me a while to make the plunge and even then it was super scary. There is a fun element to it: adventures are fun, but mostly in hindsight. When you don't know how it's going to end, it's incredibly stressful and scary. But one thing I did tell myself is that even if I have to go back to work in a traditional sense, I wasn't going to give up on this Khan Academy thing. So try to structure your endeavour in a way that it's kind of unkillable. </p>\n\n<p><strong>You mentioned that Dan Wohl was an important mentor for you.

If you think that there's a job that seems decent and it's not hell on earth but you’re going to learn something—and you learn something at every job—do that. But while you're doing that, keep a lookout for other opportunities and swing from that vine to the next. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile with your relationships — go have coffee with a lot of people, but only when you see somebody that makes you think, \"Hey, I could marry that person\" or \"I can spend my life with that person,\" then commit! It's amazing how people tend to get the two most important things completely confused. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

My family wasn’t rich but we were well off. However, I was a very unhappy kid who couldn’t find any success in school, had a very small group of friends, and couldn’t figure out why I should make an effort at anything. I faced immense pressure from my dad, who expected me to be a kicker in the NFL and a Nobel Prize winner at the same time. \n\n<img src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1376143/thumbs/a-VIVIENNE-MING-640x468.jpg?6\" alt=\"Sal Khan Commencement Address\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\">*<p align=\"center\">Vivienne, pre-transition, as Evan Smith graduating college in May 2000.</p>*\n\nAfter high school, I effectively flunked out of college, became homeless, and lived out of my car. All of the wonderful things I started off with, I squandered by the time I was 20. And with most stories like this, it involved intimate moments with suicide. There was a point in time in which I sat in my car in the middle of the night with a loaded gun shoved into my mouth and my finger on the trigger. I mention it not because it’s what I want to highlight, but rather because such moments incite real change in your life. \n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">It’s not the beautiful moments that matter, but the moments in which you need a reason to be alive.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n**What reason did you find that night?**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWell, nothing came to me so I had to make one for myself. If I would never be truly happy, my purpose was to make everyone else’s life better. Maybe this comes off as a la-di-da perspective, but slowly, I got myself back into life from one small job to another. None of them made me happy, but that’s not the point. The point is that with small steps, I proved that I could actually take care of myself. I saved enough money to go back to school and finish the last half of my degree in under a year. What changed was that I went back to school for a specific purpose — to make other people better.\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\t\t\t\t\t\n**It seems like many college students today struggle to find that purpose. It just seems like such an intangible concept.**\n\nWhatever you are doing right now, whether you like it or not, go all in. Your parents are forcing you to be an engineer even though you want to be something else? Go all in and be the best engineer you can be.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFor example, years ago I made a new glucose monitor for my son, who has Type 2 Diabetes, and it worked better than anything readily available at the time. The doctors fitted him with a monitor that could notify you of an imminent low blood sugar episode twenty minutes *after* the first drop was detected. Twenty minutes! That’s a lifetime for a worried-to-death mother! \n\n<img src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1376209/thumbs/a-NORMA-AND-VIVIENNE-MING-640x468.jpg?6\" alt=\"Sal Khan Commencement Address\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\">*<p align=\"center\">Vivienne with her wife, Norma, and their two children.</p>*\n\nI probably broke a few laws, but — for lack of a better word — I \"hacked” into his monitor to see how it obtained data, and decided I could do much better. I had my son wear a Fitbit and countless other tracking devices for months. After downloading all of the data and running tests, I finally settled on a model that could actually predict his first blood sugar drop twenty minutes in advance! I could have just stayed content with the current data and technology. Instead, I decided to create something that makes people better off.\n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\t\t\t\t\t\n**So is this the key to finding purpose and happiness? Be insanely good at something? What if your first guess isn’t the right one?**\n\t\t\t\nBe ready to move on and find the next thing. You need to be ready to die and start over again.\n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">So you just became the best engineer — now die and reincarnate as a journalist. Then an entrepreneur. A writer. A politician.\n\nAll my richest moments in life have been these moments of transition. You combine everything you learned from the last life with the problems and tools of the new life, and make things nobody has ever thought of before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSome of those moments have come out of the blue. I began working in a theoretical neuroscience lab because a professor recommended me. I had no background in machine learning at that point. We were researching the use of artificial intelligence to analyze real-time lie detection in videos for the CIA. Later, I used that same tech to help autistic kids read facial expressions and to help refugees find lost family members from facial recognition in grainy pictures. Being able to have such an impact was huge for me.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n**Have you walked away from anything huge because it didn’t align with your purpose?**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nYeah — I declined Uber’s offer to be their Chief Scientist. Taking this position meant becoming ridiculously wealthy and powerful, but my purpose isn’t self-driving cars or making Travis Kalanick ridiculously rich. I walked away because my purpose is just to help people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAmazon had a better pitch. At the time, they were about to reach 100,000 employees and wanted me to figure out how to motivate such a large workforce. It was quite the opportunity — helping 100,000 people at once! I live for this so I offered to do it for free, but they never got back to me.\n\n<div id=\"4\"></div>\t\n**Given LGBT Pride Month happened recently, and the political news around transgender discrimination, we wanted to hear the story of your transition.**\n\nI worried about transitioning for a very long time, especially since I was working at my first job at a small company in Texas. In any other life, it could’ve gone horribly. Surprisingly, my boss and coworkers were so accepting. They didn’t treat me any differently afterwards. Sure, they tripped up here and there with the name and pronouns, and some asked odd questions that were only out of genuine curiosity. But overall, their support made the process that much easier. That was a key step to becoming happy.\t\t\t\n\nWhat I said earlier about dying and being reborn again? This was one of those moments. It was complete chance that I came out on my birthday. It’s a literal birthday with double meaning.\n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">Gender transition isn’t just about gender. It’s about making yourself a better person.\n\n<div id=\"5\"></div>\t\t\t\t\t\n**Gender has been a big part of not just your identity, but also of your work on diversity in the workplace. Your article, [The Tax on Being Different](http://moment.vivienneming.com/2015/05/the-tax-on-being-different/), is a groundbreaking, data-focused look into discrimination in hiring practices.**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nI’ve always been interested in this. It was something I wanted to solve as Chief Scientist at Gild, a startup that was trying to change the hiring and promotion process through software that ranks candidates by measurable skills and hides any information that may bias the recruiter. For most employment decisions, everything amounts to an “annual 360” in which the manager is the only one in charge of making recommendations for promotion or hire. All of this is terrible. Women and people of color are being systematically undervalued.\n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">My research shows that women tend to do more untracked and uncompensated work than men, but only get recognition for 50 percent of what men get recognition for. \n\nWhy would women ever want to enter the workforce then? If I’m building a human resources system, I’m building one in which I’m tracking all of your emails, Slack conversations, and movements in the building. If she meets with someone outside of her team and I see that this other team is more productive, she’s having twice the impact on this company than what her direct manager might see from just formal data, like a survey.\n\n*(Editor's note: For more information, see Vivienne's video on [The Anatomy of a Hire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZD2XoLnEuY).)*\n\n**Data analytics is in everything now. What’s the best way to get students interested?**\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nStart off by looking at data that’s already there. So many people are trying to predict data now but we can learn so much by observing natural things around us. Humans behave naturally, but tests, models, and surveys are in no way natural.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhen people think of data, they think you just need people to fill out survey forms. In truth, simple things like tracking the trajectory of your cursor across the survey form on a computer screen and seeing how it shifts towards alternate boxes is informative. By tracking the cursor, you are measuring the person’s behavior and personality — latent things that otherwise can be inaccessible.\n\n*(Editor’s note: At Penn, MKTG351, taught by Michael Platt, teaches neuroscience marketing. Students in this class are able to use Wharton's \"secret\" eye-tracking lab.)*\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

During her time at the University of Pennsylvania, from which she graduated in 2015, Katlyn was one of the inaugural recipients of [the President’s Engagement Prize](https://pennpep.upenn.edu/projects-profiles/genheration9), which awards $150,000 to graduating seniors to develop innovative projects with a social impact focus. Her other accomplishments include being selected to participate in the 2015 Millennial Trains Project, a cross country trip for social innovators from around the world to connect and build out their ideas. At Penn, Katlyn took advantage of several entrepreneurship resources to help her grow GenHERation. Read her interview below to learn more.\n\n![alt](https://pennpep.upenn.edu/uploads/files/747271324427024457-genheration.full.jpg)\n\n<h4>Stories worth noting:</h4>\n<table class=\"bordered\">\n\n    <tr>\n        <td>1)</td>      \n        <td>Balancing entrepreneurship and full-time studies at Wharton</td>\n<td><a href=\"#1\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>        \n    <tr>\n        <td>2)</td>     \n        <td>Becoming a better entrepreneur by meeting new people every day</td>\n<td><a href=\"#2\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>\n<tr>\n        <td>3)</td>     \n        <td>Katlyn's advice about \"swimming upstream\" to be successful</td>\n<td><a href=\"#3\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n\n    </tr>\n<tr>\n        <td>4)</td>     \n        <td>Common misconceptions about being an entrepreneur</td>\n<td><a href=\"#4\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n**You worked on GenHERation for most of your time at Penn. How did you balance that with your studies at Wharton?** \n\nBeing an entrepreneur requires a certain set of skills, including persistence, determination, and resilience. It’s something that is tied to your identity and it is certainly not a 9-to-5 job. It’s a 24/7 mentality for me. College is the best time to be an entrepreneur because there is an abundance of resources available for students. There are business plan competitions, grants, research stipends, and fellowships. There are many people who want to help student entrepreneurs succeed and student founders are tasked with finding the best way to navigate the entrepreneurial ecosystem. \n\n**One issue I see is a lot of people have ideas but it’s hard to decide whether it’s worth taking on full-time or to keep it as just a side project. What convinced you to pursue GenHERation full-time?**\n\nAt the end of my junior summer, before the President’s Engagement Prize was announced, I knew I was going to be an entrepreneur full-time after graduation. I received the Wharton Venture Award, which provides $10,000 to rising seniors or second year MBAs to pursue their own venture the summer before their last year of school. At the end of that summer, we had hosted a five-city Summer Leadership Series and grew from 200 to 5,000 users.

MTP is a cross-country train trip for millennial leaders working to advance social impact projects around the world. My cohort traveled from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. over the course of ten days while visiting historical landmarks along the way. The participants on the train were some of the most inspiring people I have ever met and continue to be an active group of change-makers. The Millennial Trains Project helped me recognize the power of travel and its ability to create new communities.\n\n \n**How did you first hear about the Millennial Trains Project?**\n\nI was at a demo day for Wharton Entrepreneurship in the spring of 2015 and the leaders of Comcast’s Entrepreneurial Engagement team were in the audience. Comcast-NBCUniversal was the sponsor of the Millennial Trains Project and was looking to send an entrepreneur to represent the city of Philadelphia. I met with the team at Comcast the week after demo day and they asked me if I wanted to participate in the Millennial Trains Project. The trip started a week later, two days after graduation. \n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n**I love how this huge experience came out of one chance encounter — it’s so spontaneous! How can students get themselves more out there at school?**\n\nWhen I was a sophomore, a female entrepreneur told me I should talk to someone new every day, so I started talking to everyone and anyone I could. I talked to a diverse group of individuals ranging from professors to government leaders to business executives to university administrators. You can learn something from everyone you meet and it is an entrepreneur’s job to build a community of experts. Meeting new people every day is my favorite part of being an entrepreneur.\n\n**Who were those people or communities for you at Penn?**\n\nPenn has a vibrant entrepreneurial community that consists of many support systems, including [Penn Wharton Entrepreneurship](https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/), [the Wharton Small Business Development Center](http://whartonsbdc.wharton.upenn.edu/), [the Wharton Innovation Fund](https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/innovation-fund/), [the Baker Retailing Center](https://bakerretail.wharton.upenn.edu/), [the Wharton Social Impact Initiative](https://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/), [the Detkin Intellectual Property & Technology Legal Clinic](https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/intellectualproperty/), and [the Entrepreneurship Legal Clinic](https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/entrepreneurship/).

While everyone is swimming in one direction and pursuing a common goal, you need to swim in the opposite direction. A mentor at the Wharton Small Business Development Center once told me to make sure that you always know your end goal and pursue opportunities that put you on the path to accomplishing that goal. If you don’t feel comfortable enough jumping in and being a full-time entrepreneur right away, you can identify the next best steps that will guide you along your startup journey. First, you should work in an industry that you are passionate about and will allow you to strengthen your expertise in a given field. Next, you can try working for an organization that mimics the environment of an early stage company, such as a startup accelerator, to learn the ins and outs of the business. Alternatively, you can also join a startup that has a more established team of about 200–300 people so you can learn gradually in a collaborative setting.\n\nA lot of people who love social impact or entrepreneurship take the safe route first, hoping to come back afterwards. But they don’t realize how much harder it is to make that 180-degree pivot after being so comfortable those two years. Any founder will tell you that there is not a specific class or job that will prepare you directly for your current venture. The only way to learn is to jump in and “just do it,” as Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, would say. \n>==*Discomfort is the impetus of growth and once you become comfortable, it is time to start doing something new.==*\n\n**That’s a good rule of thumb. Two years is definitely not something to casually spend.

Every day counts when you are building a company and every task is pursued with a sense of urgency. As long as you are learning and growing from your work, it will provide you with valuable experience you can apply to any profession.\n\n<div id=\"4\"></div>\n**What are the biggest misconceptions about being an entrepreneur?**\n\nI think that people perceive being an entrepreneur to be a lot more glamorous than it really is. When we are on the road over the summer, my team and I work 20-hour days across three different time zones. Successful companies are not built over night; it requires an unwavering commitment to building something you truly believe in. If you like living in a state of constant change, being an entrepreneur will provide you with a fun and fulfilling career.\n\n**Lastly, what are your favorite books or pieces of media?**\n\nI love reading the autobiographies of successful entrepreneurs.

It’s something that is tied to your identity and it is certainly not a 9-to-5 job. It’s a 24/7 mentality for me. College is the best time to be an entrepreneur because there is an abundance of resources available for students. There are business plan competitions, grants, research stipends, and fellowships. There are many people who want to help student entrepreneurs succeed and student founders are tasked with finding the best way to navigate the entrepreneurial ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p><strong>One issue I see is a lot of people have ideas but it’s hard to decide whether it’s worth taking on full-time or to keep it as just a side project. What convinced you to pursue GenHERation full-time?</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the end of my junior summer, before the President’s Engagement Prize was announced, I knew I was going to be an entrepreneur full-time after graduation.

His repertoire of films, which include *Beauty and the Beast*, *The Fighter*, and *The Proposal*, have grossed well over $1 billion domestically. His newest movie *Stronger*, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Jeff Bauman, a survivor of the Boston Marathon bombings, is currently in theaters. Before graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995, he was a member of [The Mask and Wig Club](http://www.maskandwig.com/), the nation's oldest collegiate all-male comedy troupe.\n\n\n![alt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Stephen_Chbosky%2C_Emma_Watson_and_Todd_Lieberman.jpg)\n\n\n<h4>Stories worth noting:</h4>\n<table class=\"bordered\">\n\n    <tr>\n        <td>1)</td>      \n        <td>How Mask & Wig got him his first job in entertainment</td>\n<td><a href=\"#1\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>        \n    <tr>\n        <td>2)</td>     \n        <td>How Todd decides which movie is \"the golden nugget\" to pick up</td>\n<td><a href=\"#2\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>\n<tr>\n        <td>3)</td>     \n        <td>From spraying cologne and teaching Hebrew to “making it” in the industry</td>\n<td><a href=\"#3\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n\n    </tr>\n<tr></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n\n\n**What first got you interested in media and entertainment? Did you come into Penn with that in mind?**\n \nEver since I was a kid, I was always involved in theater doing plays and writing things and directing and producing. Simultaneously, I always loved movies. The first movie I ever saw in the movie theater was *The Champ* with Ricky Schroder and Jon Voight. It's a boxing movie, and that has a direct correlation to wanting to figure out how to do a boxing movie and finding the passion of a boxing movie. It was the first movie that I really remember seeing in the theater that I was like, \"Holy cow, like, that's possible? Maybe that's a job that someone can do, and if those kids are doing it, why can't I do it?\" — was the Goonies. It was this group of kids on this great adventure, and I was like \"God, those kids at my age. They're doing — they're working in that movie. That's incredible!\" It became the inspiration behind my movie, *The Fighter*. \n \nUltimately, that was really inspirational to me and I figured I wanted a career in that. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, where film was not really a big industry back then. Also, at the time there was no internet so you didn't know how to navigate anything. So coming into Penn, I knew I always loved entertainment and I always loved theater and movies, but there weren't really film classes here. Now, fortunately, there's a lot of new film programming. *Editor's note: Check out Penn's Cinema Studies (CIMS) department.*\n \n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n\nWhile I didn't formally study [film], I did find Mask and Wig, an on-campus comedy group. I had a great time with those guys - writing, directing, acting, singing — all that stuff. It was inspirational and there certainly is a direct correlation from that to figuring out a way to get to Los Angeles and the film business. The first real job that I ever had in Los Angeles was working as an assistant for a Mask and Wig guy ten years before me after meeting him at a Mask & Wig reunion. I spent an extraordinary amount of time in Mask and Wig and had a high level of dedication to it. It shaped and continued to cultivate my creative desires. *Editor's note: Take a look at the Fall 1994 Mask & Wig show Todd was involved in, \"[Carpe Stouffer: Seize the Tray](http://archive.maskandwig.com/Undergraduate%20Productions/1994%20Carpe%20Stouffer/Carpe%20Stouffer%20-%20Program.pdf)\"!*\n \nBut the movie business was always an enigma. I had no idea what I was going to do. Senior year of college, I moved to Los Angeles on a whim with some friends, and there you have it.\n \n**That's amazing. Since media studies at Penn at the time wasn't very developed, you ended up majoring in psychology, right? Was that a deliberate choice?** \n \nI wish I had a high-level answer to that question. The real answer is I don't remember, but it felt just like a way to get through school.\n \n**So you just wanted to focus on Mask and Wig and extracurriculars?**\n \nIt wasn't even that I wanted to focus on Mask and Wig. Frankly, the one regret I have about my undergraduate experience is that I wish I had taken more classes. I wish I had taken advantage of the education that was offered here.\n \nI still have an extreme interest in psychology. I think the human brain is fascinating but I never intended to be a psychologist. I really didn't know what I wanted to do, honestly. The idea of the movie business, of a career in entertainment, wasn't something that seemed accessible. It wasn't like I came from a family in entertainment or knew anyone that did it. I grew up in Cleveland. My dad was a dentist and my mom was a school teacher.  \n\n>==There wasn't a clear path to film so college was not only an amazing experience of meeting people that I still have longstanding relationships with, Mask and Wig, and the high level of education, but it was also a way of finding confidence in myself — knowing what I liked and didn't like, exploring different avenues so that by the time I got to senior year, I had the confidence to be able to give film a shot.==\n \n**If you were to go back to young Todd and give yourself some advice on how to build this confidence and be more prepared, what would you say?**\n\nTwo things. One is, I would get my hand on as many screenplays as possible and continually read. Plays and musicals are two-act structures. Movies are three-act structures. I wasn't familiar with that so it took me many years to cultivate my taste, know structures, and understand how characters worked within that. You should write at least ten scripts before you show them to anyone because you want to cultivate that skill set.\n \nHad I known I had the resources to do it, I would have read the scripts for movies I liked and didn't like to learn both sides — to not only understand structure, character, and emotion but to also hone in on what I loved about a story and what my taste was. \n \n**Can you remember one moment that was just so powerful and so great about being a producer that you were like, \"I just absolutely love where I am now\"?**\n \nOh boy. My favorite part of producing is the discovery of a story, finding that nugget that you emotionally connect with and saying - 'Oh my gosh, I really want to make others see this the way I see it' - and then unveiling that vision. There have been so many moments in which you sit in a room full of people and show them a film that you're really proud of and see them collectively get moved by the experience. There's nothing like it.\n\n![alt](https://indierevolver.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/stronger.jpg)\n**Is there a movie that most vividly stood out to you in that way?**\n\n*Stronger* is really emblematic of that. There's an extraordinary amount of emotion and uplift that comes from this movie. If I've seen a movie multiple times, I don't watch the screen anymore, I just watch the crowd. In a comedy, you know when something's working when you hear that uproar of laughter. For a movie like *The Proposal*, I think of times when you can't hear the lines because the laughter is so loud. For a movie like *The Fighter*, I think of that rousing third act and feeling the energy of the crowd. But in a drama, I'll look for someone wiping their eyes. In this particular movie, *Stronger*, there are multiple instances where you'll see hands go up to faces. \n\n**So on the flip side, what are some difficult moments you had as a producer?**\n\nThe hard part about being a producer is that there isn't a specified job description. There isn't one particular thing that you are the best at so you have to know a little bit about everything.\n\nThe challenge as a producer is knowing when it's my turn to step in and change direction, while also having the confidence to step back and know that the process will figure itself out. It's like being the CEO of a mini-corporation.\n \nIt's managerial, but it's also very creative. It's no secret that there's a lot of personalities in the movie business, so my job involves balancing a lot of different opinions. It's my job to corral that and make sure that everyone feels good about the direction we're headed: everyone feels heard, no one feels ostracized, and we're kind of a big family unit of many people moving forward to a collective vision.\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n \n**As a producer, you sometimes see tens or hundreds of scripts before you find the right one — the golden nugget. For you, how do you know?**\n \nI make decisions — this is going to sound really corny — with my gut and heart rather than my head. I never tend to intellectualize or analyze something. I truly go off of how it affects me. And that's really it. I guess people call that a gut check.\n \nIf I'm laughing, tearing up, or feeling inspired, that signals to me that I can't be the only one in the world who will feel that. That's kind of my barometer.\n \n**There are a lot of jobs that have very clear-cut paths. Film can be the complete opposite sometimes. How did you have the confidence to know that this is what you want to do?**\n \nI wish I could call it confidence. At that time [at Penn], it really was complete naïveté. I was just going in blindly and thought \"oh, that sounds cool.\" Confidence in ignorance is what it was.\n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n \n**I love the brutal honesty. How did you navigate that first year in Los Angeles?**\n \nNot well.\n\n>==I had about 18,000 different jobs. I was on a television series, I was spraying cologne, I was a bartender, I was a bouncer, I was teaching at a Hebrew school. I was doing all kinds of things that were all over the place. I just kind of figured my way out there.==\n\nI didn't even know what producing was, frankly. I just knew that somehow, somewhere I wanted to be involved in movies.\n \n**How did you keep yourself motivated?**\n \nYou know, in retrospect, I suppose it should have been discouraging but it wasn't so. I remember very vividly just approaching it day-by-day rather than worrying about my long-term plans.\n \n>==In the same way that I analyze scripts, the choices I make in my life either feel good or don't feel good. I know that if I didn't feel like I was doing the right thing, I would have done something else.==\n\n**Lastly, if your life was a movie that you're producing, what are the two main scenes so far that made you who you are today?**\n \nWow, a very philosophical question. \n \nOne is my decision to move to LA. Though at the moment, it didn't feel like such a big moment. It just felt like something I needed to do. But now, suddenly, I have a family, a wife and two kids, and consider LA my home. It's very strange for me to think that that is where I ended up. \n \nThe other one is the decision to go to Penn. The decision was a random one, in the same way that everything else seems to be. We were on a college tour on the East Coast, and my mom was the one who said we should stop at Penn.

Did you come into Penn with that in mind?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ever since I was a kid, I was always involved in theater doing plays and writing things and directing and producing. Simultaneously, I always loved movies. The first movie I ever saw in the movie theater was <em>The Champ</em> with Ricky Schroder and Jon Voight. It's a boxing movie, and that has a direct correlation to wanting to figure out how to do a boxing movie and finding the passion of a boxing movie. It was the first movie that I really remember seeing in the theater that I was like, \"Holy cow, like, that's possible? Maybe that's a job that someone can do, and if those kids are doing it, why can't I do it?\" — was the Goonies. It was this group of kids on this great adventure, and I was like \"God, those kids at my age. They're doing — they're working in that movie. That's incredible!\" It became the inspiration behind my movie, <em>The Fighter</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, that was really inspirational to me and I figured I wanted a career in that. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, where film was not really a big industry back then. Also, at the time there was no internet so you didn't know how to navigate anything. So coming into Penn, I knew I always loved entertainment and I always loved theater and movies, but there weren't really film classes here. Now, fortunately, there's a lot of new film programming. <em>Editor's note: Check out Penn's Cinema Studies (CIMS) department.</em></p>\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n\n<p>While I didn't formally study [film], I did find Mask and Wig, an on-campus comedy group. I had a great time with those guys - writing, directing, acting, singing — all that stuff. It was inspirational and there certainly is a direct correlation from that to figuring out a way to get to Los Angeles and the film business. The first real job that I ever had in Los Angeles was working as an assistant for a Mask and Wig guy ten years before me after meeting him at a Mask &amp; Wig reunion. I spent an extraordinary amount of time in Mask and Wig and had a high level of dedication to it. It shaped and continued to cultivate my creative desires. <em>Editor's note: Take a look at the Fall 1994 Mask &amp; Wig show Todd was involved in, \"<a href=\"http://archive.maskandwig.com/Undergraduate%20Productions/1994%20Carpe%20Stouffer/Carpe%20Stouffer%20-%20Program.pdf\">Carpe Stouffer: Seize the Tray</a>\"!</em></p>\n\n<p>But the movie business was always an enigma. I had no idea what I was going to do. Senior year of college, I moved to Los Angeles on a whim with some friends, and there you have it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That's amazing. Since media studies at Penn at the time wasn't very developed, you ended up majoring in psychology, right? Was that a deliberate choice?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I wish I had a high-level answer to that question. The real answer is I don't remember, but it felt just like a way to get through school.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So you just wanted to focus on Mask and Wig and extracurriculars?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It wasn't even that I wanted to focus on Mask and Wig. Frankly, the one regret I have about my undergraduate experience is that I wish I had taken more classes. I wish I had taken advantage of the education that was offered here.</p>\n\n<p>I still have an extreme interest in psychology. I think the human brain is fascinating but I never intended to be a psychologist. I really didn't know what I wanted to do, honestly. The idea of the movie business, of a career in entertainment, wasn't something that seemed accessible. It wasn't like I came from a family in entertainment or knew anyone that did it. I grew up in Cleveland. My dad was a dentist and my mom was a school teacher.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>There wasn't a clear path to film so college was not only an amazing experience of meeting people that I still have longstanding relationships with, Mask and Wig, and the high level of education, but it was also a way of finding confidence in myself — knowing what I liked and didn't like, exploring different avenues so that by the time I got to senior year, I had the confidence to be able to give film a shot.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>If you were to go back to young Todd and give yourself some advice on how to build this confidence and be more prepared, what would you say?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Two things. One is, I would get my hand on as many screenplays as possible and continually read. Plays and musicals are two-act structures. Movies are three-act structures. I wasn't familiar with that so it took me many years to cultivate my taste, know structures, and understand how characters worked within that. You should write at least ten scripts before you show them to anyone because you want to cultivate that skill set.</p>\n\n<p>Had I known I had the resources to do it, I would have read the scripts for movies I liked and didn't like to learn both sides — to not only understand structure, character, and emotion but to also hone in on what I loved about a story and what my taste was. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you remember one moment that was just so powerful and so great about being a producer that you were like, \"I just absolutely love where I am now\"?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Oh boy. My favorite part of producing is the discovery of a story, finding that nugget that you emotionally connect with and saying - 'Oh my gosh, I really want to make others see this the way I see it' - and then unveiling that vision. There have been so many moments in which you sit in a room full of people and show them a film that you're really proud of and see them collectively get moved by the experience. There's nothing like it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://indierevolver.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/stronger.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" />\n<strong>Is there a movie that most vividly stood out to you in that way?</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Stronger</em> is really emblematic of that. There's an extraordinary amount of emotion and uplift that comes from this movie. If I've seen a movie multiple times, I don't watch the screen anymore, I just watch the crowd. In a comedy, you know when something's working when you hear that uproar of laughter. For a movie like <em>The Proposal</em>, I think of times when you can't hear the lines because the laughter is so loud. For a movie like <em>The Fighter</em>, I think of that rousing third act and feeling the energy of the crowd. But in a drama, I'll look for someone wiping their eyes. In this particular movie, <em>Stronger</em>, there are multiple instances where you'll see hands go up to faces. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So on the flip side, what are some difficult moments you had as a producer?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The hard part about being a producer is that there isn't a specified job description. There isn't one particular thing that you are the best at so you have to know a little bit about everything.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge as a producer is knowing when it's my turn to step in and change direction, while also having the confidence to step back and know that the process will figure itself out. It's like being the CEO of a mini-corporation.</p>\n\n<p>It's managerial, but it's also very creative. It's no secret that there's a lot of personalities in the movie business, so my job involves balancing a lot of different opinions. It's my job to corral that and make sure that everyone feels good about the direction we're headed: everyone feels heard, no one feels ostracized, and we're kind of a big family unit of many people moving forward to a collective vision.</p>\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n<p><strong>As a producer, you sometimes see tens or hundreds of scripts before you find the right one — the golden nugget. For you, how do you know?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I make decisions — this is going to sound really corny — with my gut and heart rather than my head. I never tend to intellectualize or analyze something. I truly go off of how it affects me. And that's really it. I guess people call that a gut check.</p>\n\n<p>If I'm laughing, tearing up, or feeling inspired, that signals to me that I can't be the only one in the world who will feel that. That's kind of my barometer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There are a lot of jobs that have very clear-cut paths. Film can be the complete opposite sometimes. How did you have the confidence to know that this is what you want to do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I wish I could call it confidence. At that time [at Penn], it really was complete naïveté. I was just going in blindly and thought \"oh, that sounds cool.\" Confidence in ignorance is what it was.</p>\n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n\n<p><strong>I love the brutal honesty. How did you navigate that first year in Los Angeles?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not well.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>I had about 18,000 different jobs. I was on a television series, I was spraying cologne, I was a bartender, I was a bouncer, I was teaching at a Hebrew school. I was doing all kinds of things that were all over the place. I just kind of figured my way out there.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn't even know what producing was, frankly. I just knew that somehow, somewhere I wanted to be involved in movies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did you keep yourself motivated?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You know, in retrospect, I suppose it should have been discouraging but it wasn't so. I remember very vividly just approaching it day-by-day rather than worrying about my long-term plans.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>In the same way that I analyze scripts, the choices I make in my life either feel good or don't feel good. I know that if I didn't feel like I was doing the right thing, I would have done something else.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Lastly, if your life was a movie that you're producing, what are the two main scenes so far that made you who you are today?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wow, a very philosophical question. </p>\n\n<p>One is my decision to move to LA. Though at the moment, it didn't feel like such a big moment. It just felt like something I needed to do. But now, suddenly, I have a family, a wife and two kids, and consider LA my home. It's very strange for me to think that that is where I ended up. </p>\n\n<p>The other one is the decision to go to Penn. The decision was a random one, in the same way that everything else seems to be. We were on a college tour on the East Coast, and my mom was the one who said we should stop at Penn. And I was like, \"Ah, nah.\" But we were driving through on the way to Boston and so we stopped there anyway. I looked around the campus and I ended up meeting somebody who happened to be the Midwest Regional Director of Admissions. We sat and talked for two hours and in that moment, Penn became the place I was going to go.</p>\n\n<p>That decision informed basically all the rest of my decisions — the confidence to do Mask and Wig and meet all these different people, which enabled the passion to go to Los Angeles to make movies, and you know the rest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> \n<em>I was introduced to Todd by Matt Rosler, a former President of the Penn Club of Los Angeles and creator of <a href=\"http://penntertainment.com/\">Penntertainment</a>, a community website for Penn students and alums interested in media &amp; entertainment.

She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 1991 and started working for a big company in New York City before becoming “disillusioned with corporate life.” After a year of backpacking around the world, she moved to Palo Alto and have since been “hooked on the Valley way — combine big ideas, smart people, hard work, and a little bit of luck and great things will ensue.” Her adventures include dropping out of Stanford to co-found her first company, WeddingChannel.com, a gift-registry aggregator; starting another named Bella Pictures; and attending the Circus Center in San Francisco for contortionism.\n\n<h4>Stories worth noting:</h4>\n<table class=\"bordered\">\n\n <tr>\n        <td>1)</td>      \n        <td>From accounting to backpacking around the world to startups.</td>\n<td><a href=\"#1\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>        \n    <tr>\n        <td>2)</td>     \n        <td>Dropping out of Stanford before it was cool.</td>\n<td><a href=\"#2\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>\n<tr>\n        <td>3)</td>     \n        <td>Why business is crucial in the tech world.</td>\n<td><a href=\"#3\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n\n    </tr>\n<tr></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n\n**You started off in accounting and you mentioned it wasn't enough. Why did you choose to go into accounting and then how you made the shift to entrepreneurship?**\n\nFrom being a Wharton undergrad and having a concentration in accounting to coming from a family of CPAs (Certified Public Accountants), it felt like a very responsible path to go down, a failsafe I could fall back on. All the firms come to campus and give you offers — it's so easy. So I followed the path of least resistance. I remember actually crying before I started, saying, \"Why did I do this? I know this is not what I want to do.\" But here I was. \n\nIt was not the job for me. I wish I could tell you that I learned so much, that it was amazing. In the first few years as an auditor, you're not supposed to think. The general consensus is “what we did last year is what we do this year.” \n\n>==I worked two years to the day, quit, and went off to backpack around the world with a friend with no idea what I wanted to do. I just knew I had to close that door because life's too short.==\n\nWhen I returned to the states, my boyfriend — now husband — was at Stanford. I went to their career center and — this is pre-Internet — looked through every binder of jobs. I took down jobs in nonprofits, teaching — you name it. I had no idea what to do, but the job descriptions in Silicon Valley sounded so fun, so I applied to work at a software company as a junior marketer. I remember at the interview, I was having conversations with some of the smartest people I had ever met, but they were all wearing shorts and T-shirts and I was blown away.\n\nI really loved that job. It was a meritocracy. The more you were willing to do, the more they were willing to give you. It was the first time that I had experienced how I want to work. I did that for three years, then went to the Stanford Graduate Business School in 1997. While studying there, I worked on a business plan for WeddingChannel, more as a way to learn about venture capital and entrepreneurship than actually being that serious about our business. But as we worked more and more on it, we got very serious about it, believed in it, and once we got a term sheet from Kleiner Perkins at the end of our first year, I decided to drop out of business school and pursue that. *Editor’s note: A term sheet is a legal document denoting the financial agreements between the venture capital firm and the startup. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) is a leading venture capital company.*\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n**That must have been quite a leap of faith to drop out of Stanford to pursue that! Was there a specific moment in which you actually knew WeddingChannel was a winner?**\n\nThe moment we got a term sheet and got funding, there was no question. People say, \"God that must have been so hard,\" and I know it sounds unbelievable — but it just wasn't that hard. \n\n>==I went to business school to have doors open. They just opened up early. My co-founder and I sat there asking ourselves, “So should we?” and we're both like, “Yeah.” It was a no-brainer for us.==\n\nI remember going to the Dean — this is before people regularly dropped out of business school — and we explained, \"Hey, we would love to pursue this. Now there's a chance it won't work out, and if it doesn't, we would love to come back.” And he said, “If you want to come back, it's because you failed, and we don't want failures here.” We're like, “Well, that wraps it up!” They have changed the policy since, as they realized too much is going on in the world and the dot-com era called upon too many people, so they got a lot more flexible. But since we were first, they were not prepared for that. I still have a great relationship with Stanford: I love that school, I speak there, I give there. It's all good.\n\n**That's surprising to hear “we don’t want failures here” was Stanford’s attitude back then in 1997. Now, failure seems to be encouraged in the Valley.**\n\nYeah, it's a very different world that we're in now. He had said to us, \"Listen, if it’s that good of a business, it'll still be here in a year [once you graduate],\" and we're like, \"No, it won't.\" Here's an opportunity that we think is a perfect application for purchasing on the Internet. It won't be here in a year — someone will take it. This was a new phenomenon back then. Now, you don’t have the luxury of time. \n\n**So comparing your time as a founder during the dot-com era vs as a venture capitalist now, what do you think has changed in how people approach entrepreneurship?**\n\nNow, everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. It's the hip thing to do, but it's really not for everyone. The media glamorizes it, but it's hard as hell. It's lonely, it's grueling, it takes a lot out of you. The people who did it back in the day really had a vision and really couldn't carry on without it coming to fruition or at least trying. \n\nNow people are saying, \"Oh, I really want to start something,\" and then they try to come up with ideas. Since there’s a lot of smart people going down that path and so much capital available, you end up with a lot more noise. You get a lot of businesses that maybe shouldn't be funded because they're not meant to be big businesses or there are five other people doing the same thing. But people will fund them because there's so much capital. \n\n![alt](http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/TechCrunch+Disrupt+SF+2016+Day+2+jBRmVorWaXdl.jpg)\n*Jenny Lefcourt has served as a startup pitch judge at TechCrunch Disrupt since 2016.*\n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n\n**You started off in business and then founded an internet startup. At Penn, I can't even tell you the number of students who have asked, \"I only know business. What does the tech world really see in me?\" They have this fear that they aren’t valued as much or that they can't do much there. Did you have that fear going in and what were the biggest challenges you had to face?**\n\nThe biggest challenges were what we were doing strategically. For example, Amazon.com had just gone public then and was doing really well. At the time, they were only selling books online and it makes sense that people would buy a book online because you know exactly what you're buying. There's no mystery because you don't need to touch and feel it. We asked ourselves what else has those attributes and decided wedding gifts are perfect. If you put a vase on your on your registry and it's the right price point for me, I don't need to touch and feel it. You already picked it out and I just need to buy it for you.\n\nThoroughly understanding the customer, and understanding how the market should work was essential. The biggest challenge is getting the retailers to see our vision and work with a startup. They were giving us their incredible brands like Neiman Marcus and Crate and Barrel, all to create this new experience. The tech is obviously something that has to be created but it wasn't rocket science. We brought on a third co-founder who heads tech and had a giant tech team because back in the day, you had to build everything from scratch. I don't mean to say tech didn't matter. \n>==But it really was the business model, the partnerships we created, and the experience we provided for the brides and grooms and their gift buyers that was going to make or break this business, not the technology that enabled it.==\n\n**Do you recommend that non-technical people still learn that technical side?**\n\nObviously that's a bonus. No matter what you're building, tech is going to be a big part of it. Even if you're not the one coding it or in charge of your engineers, understanding it is going to be positive. Do I think you must be technical in order to be successful? No, I do not. But I think then you have to be able to find someone that you know and trust who shares the same values, same leadership so that they can create the technology that supports the business that you're creating.\n\n**Stay tuned for [Part 2: Women in Venture Capital!](http://thesign.al/jenny-lefcourt-on-dropping-out-of-stanford-before-it-was-cool-part-2/)**\n\n***Editor’s Note:*** *I first met Jenny on the [Wharton San Francisco](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep-sf/) trip in January in which she told us her story, along with several other alums.

All the firms come to campus and give you offers — it's so easy. So I followed the path of least resistance. I remember actually crying before I started, saying, \"Why did I do this? I know this is not what I want to do.\" But here I was. </p>\n\n<p>It was not the job for me. I wish I could tell you that I learned so much, that it was amazing. In the first few years as an auditor, you're not supposed to think. The general consensus is “what we did last year is what we do this year.” </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>I worked two years to the day, quit, and went off to backpack around the world with a friend with no idea what I wanted to do. I just knew I had to close that door because life's too short.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I returned to the states, my boyfriend — now husband — was at Stanford. I went to their career center and — this is pre-Internet — looked through every binder of jobs. I took down jobs in nonprofits, teaching — you name it. I had no idea what to do, but the job descriptions in Silicon Valley sounded so fun, so I applied to work at a software company as a junior marketer. I remember at the interview, I was having conversations with some of the smartest people I had ever met, but they were all wearing shorts and T-shirts and I was blown away.</p>\n\n<p>I really loved that job. It was a meritocracy. The more you were willing to do, the more they were willing to give you. It was the first time that I had experienced how I want to work. I did that for three years, then went to the Stanford Graduate Business School in 1997. While studying there, I worked on a business plan for WeddingChannel, more as a way to learn about venture capital and entrepreneurship than actually being that serious about our business. But as we worked more and more on it, we got very serious about it, believed in it, and once we got a term sheet from Kleiner Perkins at the end of our first year, I decided to drop out of business school and pursue that. <em>Editor’s note: A term sheet is a legal document denoting the financial agreements between the venture capital firm and the startup. Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB) is a leading venture capital company.</em></p>\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n<p><strong>That must have been quite a leap of faith to drop out of Stanford to pursue that! Was there a specific moment in which you actually knew WeddingChannel was a winner?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The moment we got a term sheet and got funding, there was no question. People say, \"God that must have been so hard,\" and I know it sounds unbelievable — but it just wasn't that hard. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>I went to business school to have doors open. They just opened up early. My co-founder and I sat there asking ourselves, “So should we?” and we're both like, “Yeah.” It was a no-brainer for us.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I remember going to the Dean — this is before people regularly dropped out of business school — and we explained, \"Hey, we would love to pursue this. Now there's a chance it won't work out, and if it doesn't, we would love to come back.” And he said, “If you want to come back, it's because you failed, and we don't want failures here.” We're like, “Well, that wraps it up!” They have changed the policy since, as they realized too much is going on in the world and the dot-com era called upon too many people, so they got a lot more flexible. But since we were first, they were not prepared for that. I still have a great relationship with Stanford: I love that school, I speak there, I give there. It's all good.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That's surprising to hear “we don’t want failures here” was Stanford’s attitude back then in 1997. Now, failure seems to be encouraged in the Valley.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yeah, it's a very different world that we're in now. He had said to us, \"Listen, if it’s that good of a business, it'll still be here in a year [once you graduate],\" and we're like, \"No, it won't.\" Here's an opportunity that we think is a perfect application for purchasing on the Internet. It won't be here in a year — someone will take it. This was a new phenomenon back then. Now, you don’t have the luxury of time. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So comparing your time as a founder during the dot-com era vs as a venture capitalist now, what do you think has changed in how people approach entrepreneurship?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now, everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. It's the hip thing to do, but it's really not for everyone. The media glamorizes it, but it's hard as hell. It's lonely, it's grueling, it takes a lot out of you. The people who did it back in the day really had a vision and really couldn't carry on without it coming to fruition or at least trying. </p>\n\n<p>Now people are saying, \"Oh, I really want to start something,\" and then they try to come up with ideas. Since there’s a lot of smart people going down that path and so much capital available, you end up with a lot more noise. You get a lot of businesses that maybe shouldn't be funded because they're not meant to be big businesses or there are five other people doing the same thing. But people will fund them because there's so much capital. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/TechCrunch+Disrupt+SF+2016+Day+2+jBRmVorWaXdl.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" />\n<em>Jenny Lefcourt has served as a startup pitch judge at TechCrunch Disrupt since 2016.</em></p>\n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n\n<p><strong>You started off in business and then founded an internet startup. At Penn, I can't even tell you the number of students who have asked, \"I only know business. What does the tech world really see in me?\" They have this fear that they aren’t valued as much or that they can't do much there. Did you have that fear going in and what were the biggest challenges you had to face?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The biggest challenges were what we were doing strategically. For example, Amazon.com had just gone public then and was doing really well. At the time, they were only selling books online and it makes sense that people would buy a book online because you know exactly what you're buying. There's no mystery because you don't need to touch and feel it. We asked ourselves what else has those attributes and decided wedding gifts are perfect. If you put a vase on your on your registry and it's the right price point for me, I don't need to touch and feel it. You already picked it out and I just need to buy it for you.</p>\n\n<p>Thoroughly understanding the customer, and understanding how the market should work was essential. The biggest challenge is getting the retailers to see our vision and work with a startup. They were giving us their incredible brands like Neiman Marcus and Crate and Barrel, all to create this new experience. The tech is obviously something that has to be created but it wasn't rocket science. We brought on a third co-founder who heads tech and had a giant tech team because back in the day, you had to build everything from scratch. I don't mean to say tech didn't matter.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>But it really was the business model, the partnerships we created, and the experience we provided for the brides and grooms and their gift buyers that was going to make or break this business, not the technology that enabled it.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Do you recommend that non-technical people still learn that technical side?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Obviously that's a bonus. No matter what you're building, tech is going to be a big part of it. Even if you're not the one coding it or in charge of your engineers, understanding it is going to be positive. Do I think you must be technical in order to be successful? No, I do not. But I think then you have to be able to find someone that you know and trust who shares the same values, same leadership so that they can create the technology that supports the business that you're creating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stay tuned for <a href=\"http://thesign.al/jenny-lefcourt-on-dropping-out-of-stanford-before-it-was-cool-part-2/\">Part 2: Women in Venture Capital!</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Editor’s Note:</em></strong> <em>I first met Jenny on the <a href=\"https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep-sf/\">Wharton San Francisco</a> trip in January in which she told us her story, along with several other alums.

She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 1991 and started working for a big company in New York City before becoming “disillusioned with corporate life.” After a year of backpacking around the world, she moved to Palo Alto and have since been “hooked on the Valley way — combine big ideas, smart people, hard work, and a little bit of luck and great things will ensue.” Her adventures include dropping out of Stanford to co-found her first company, WeddingChannel.com, a gift-registry aggregator; starting another named Bella Pictures; and attending the Circus Center in San Francisco for contortionism.\n\n<h4>Stories worth noting:</h4>\n<table class=\"bordered\">\n\n <tr>\n        <td>1)</td>      \n        <td>Venture capital vs. entrepreneurship.</td>\n<td><a href=\"#1\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>        \n    <tr>\n        <td>2)</td>     \n        <td>Avoiding burnout at the young, exciting age of 40.</td>\n<td><a href=\"#2\"><button class=\"button1\" style=\"align:center\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\n    </tr>\n<tr>\n\n    </tr>\n<tr></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n**One thing you said earlier really stuck out to me: You chose the path of least resistance and that ended up not working well for you. That's something a lot of people here can take note of. People do it because they aren't well informed about what else is out there and/or what they want to do. And so the Sign.al was made originally to tackle that. But the only solution I see to get students past that is to get them to know earlier.**\n\n**What's your advice on how students can learn earlier? What do you wish you did as an undergrad to get a more informed idea of what you want to do before you graduate?** \n\nIt's a great question that I actually don't know the answer to. I never looked back and said, \"I wish I had done something else during my college years.\"\n\n>==It was more about when it happened, recognizing it and then making sure that I managed my way out of it because I didn't want to wake up in eight years and still be there, knowing the whole time that it was not my passion.==\n\nSo, there's a few things. One is whatever anyone does, they should be really conscious about the choices that they're making. If you want to work on Wall Street or you want to be a management consultant, know what it is exactly that you’ll be doing and why you're doing it. You should go find out more about that thing you need to understand to make the right decision. There's so much that can be found online: readings, internships, speakers. There's so much access.\n\nSo when people are doing analyses of what their move should be, it should never be, “I don't know enough about blank even though I'm so interested and so I'll go take a different route.” That's just wasted time. There's nothing wrong with saying that I think one day I want to be an entrepreneur or blank. But right now, since I don't have the skills or the idea or the network yet, I'm going to go do this other thing because I'm going to learn a lot and I'm excited about that. That is okay.\n\n**That makes sense. For me, the deliberate decisions were driven by my experiences on a trip to explore the San Francisco tech industry, organized by Wharton, where I first met you. It really helped me and others on the trek understand what else is out there in the tech world that we wouldn't have understood from going to a bunch of info sessions at Penn, especially at Wharton, where they are more finance and consulting focused. Those were incredibly instrumental for me and I bet there's a lot of other resources out there that I just haven't come across yet.**\n\n*Editors Note: [Treks](http://whartontechclub.com/treks/), like the one I met Jenny on, that I recommend are Wharton SF Tech, Wharton LA Media & Entertainment, Wharton NYC Tech, and Penn Tech Trek.*\n\nThey are there. You just need to dig. There are so many great intern programs. Freestyle has one. We are a $60 million fund and we took in six college students and placed them in our portfolio companies. I definitely recommend you do an internship in this other world if you’re remotely interested. It’s a wonderful way to get exposure. \n\n**I wish I had heard this earlier because I had plenty of summers in which I could have done something unique. Everyone has competitive, pre-professional mindsets, thinking, \"If I think I want to do X full time, then I have to get a junior year internship in that industry so that I can prove I can do it full time, and so I have to get a sophomore year internship in that industry so that I can prove I do it junior year.\" And people keep pushing it back to where now even freshmen are concerned about their summer, that they can't get that internship which will then provide some kind of domino effect to a full-time opportunity.**\n\nTotally, totally. Once again, it's just so easy. Those firms come, they make you great offers, and all your friends are doing it. I get it and it's fine for a lot of people. \n\n>==But if you are interested in this other world or you don't even know if you are, but you want to know if you are, then you should absolutely try that because the traditional jobs will always be there.==\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n\n**So you mentioned [Freestyle](http://freestyle.vc/). Let's talk more about your VC life. You started off in entrepreneurship, which is more operational work. Now as a VC, it’s all investing. What was your motivation behind the switch?**\n\nMy advice is if you think one day you want to be a VC — and this is super biased — you should learn how to operate. If you can be a founder, be a founder. If you can join a young startup and learn how to operate, do that. There's nothing like living it to then be on the other side and know what to look for in investing. You’ll be a good coach, having been there and done that. You can add more value with empathy and insight than you can if you just looking at it through the ivory tower.\n\n![alt](http://c93fea60bb98e121740fc38ff31162a8.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/freestyle_team.jpeg)\n*Jenny with her co-partners of Freestyle VC.*\n\nI had done a few startups and now I am married and have three kids. Startup life is really hard for good balance. I get so much joy out of working with entrepreneurs and being the person behind the scenes that helps them be successful. \n\nFor young people, do things that are harder to do when you're older. Being an entrepreneur while you're young is just a hell of a lot easier to do than when you have a family and children and whatnot. \n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n**I definitely agree. I always thought that one of the most powerful things about being young and fresh out of college is that you have this energy and enthusiasm and passion to go out and solve a lot of things. Obviously, this is coming from a very grandiose mindset that I have as a 21-year-old right now, but this energy matters. Many different places I’ve worked at didn't push me creatively or to think outside of the box. Personally I call it \"feeling like an adult.\" That's my metaphor for it.**\n\nBut I will say I'm 40 years old and have a ton of energy and passion and excitement. When I was 28 and working on my first company, I didn't need balance. It was so easy to completely indulge in that and I loved indulging in my career. It wasn't hard. I mean, it was hard but it was fun. It was exactly what I wanted to be doing. I would never do that at this point in my life with a family. I would miss out on too much. So it's not that I don't have the energy, I just have too much other responsibilities and opportunities that I don't want to miss. \n\n**I find that really admirable, just having that same energy now. Some older friends of mine who are still in their twenties feel burnt out already from what they're doing. How did you manage not to burn out? Was it something in your job or was it a life habit or philosophy?** \n\nWorkplace balance is one of those things that gets thrown around and I don't really see that as goal. I see happiness as the goal. And so every person is different. If you're an introvert or an extrovert, you should recognize where your natural energy is. Your job is to make sure that you take care of yourself to have the energy to not get burnt out.\n\nSo I didn't mind giving up a lot of social action during those years because I loved my work and we were having fun and building stuff together. I saw my husband plenty, I didn't have kids, and so I just made sure that I slept well, I ate well, and did yoga. Other than that, I could give everything to the company. Some people need more than that. Some need less.\n\n>==Just make sure that you have the stamina to keep on going. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon.==\n\n***Editor’s Note:*** *I first met Jenny on the [Wharton San Francisco](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep-sf/) trip in January in which she told us her story, along with several other alums.

I get so much joy out of working with entrepreneurs and being the person behind the scenes that helps them be successful. </p>\n\n<p>For young people, do things that are harder to do when you're older. Being an entrepreneur while you're young is just a hell of a lot easier to do than when you have a family and children and whatnot. </p>\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n<p><strong>I definitely agree. I always thought that one of the most powerful things about being young and fresh out of college is that you have this energy and enthusiasm and passion to go out and solve a lot of things. Obviously, this is coming from a very grandiose mindset that I have as a 21-year-old right now, but this energy matters. Many different places I’ve worked at didn't push me creatively or to think outside of the box. Personally I call it \"feeling like an adult.\" That's my metaphor for it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>But I will say I'm 40 years old and have a ton of energy and passion and excitement. When I was 28 and working on my first company, I didn't need balance. It was so easy to completely indulge in that and I loved indulging in my career. It wasn't hard. I mean, it was hard but it was fun. It was exactly what I wanted to be doing. I would never do that at this point in my life with a family. I would miss out on too much. So it's not that I don't have the energy, I just have too much other responsibilities and opportunities that I don't want to miss. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I find that really admirable, just having that same energy now. Some older friends of mine who are still in their twenties feel burnt out already from what they're doing. How did you manage not to burn out? Was it something in your job or was it a life habit or philosophy?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Workplace balance is one of those things that gets thrown around and I don't really see that as goal. I see happiness as the goal. And so every person is different. If you're an introvert or an extrovert, you should recognize where your natural energy is. Your job is to make sure that you take care of yourself to have the energy to not get burnt out.</p>\n\n<p>So I didn't mind giving up a lot of social action during those years because I loved my work and we were having fun and building stuff together. I saw my husband plenty, I didn't have kids, and so I just made sure that I slept well, I ate well, and did yoga. Other than that, I could give everything to the company. Some people need more than that. Some need less.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>Just make sure that you have the stamina to keep on going. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Editor’s Note:</em></strong> <em>I first met Jenny on the <a href=\"https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep-sf/\">Wharton San Francisco</a> trip in January in which she told us her story, along with several other alums.

I’m proud to call her a strong role-model of mine and hope her story can inspire many more students to keep hustling despite societal pressures.</em></p>",

At Penn, I majored in Creative Writing - which is ostensibly useless unless you want to be a writer or a professor — and I minored in psychology and marketing. But my extracurricular side was entirely business-oriented. I think balance is really important. My predominant activity at Penn was the [Ivy Council](https://www.ivycouncil.org/). At the time, it was more of a student consortium, but I resurrected it from obscurity. My favorite thing to do, and probably my greatest skill, is building something from nothing. \n\nWhen I graduated, it was the height of the economic recession. Around 40 percent of my peers were unemployed, which is unheard of coming from an Ivy League school. I was very lucky. My dream since childhood was to be the next Walt Disney, and I basically had two choices. One is I could go down the traditional media path, in which I write, produce, direct, and star; or, I could go learn how to build a system. \n\nSo, I went to Google [to build a system]. I ended up being the only person from Penn to get an offer into Google’s Executive Management program. I created what the world now knows is the multibillion dollar influencer ecosystem at YouTube. I left about three years ago and now own two of my own companies: one is a tech company and the other is a content studio that’s launching later this year. Around 70 percent of my time is invested in launching my content studio, which is my childhood dream, and 20 percent of my time is investing in advising digital media companies. And then finally 10 percent of my time is spent community-building, focused on making the Asian community more cohesive and influential.\n\n<img src= \"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-10-11-Bing1.jpeg\" alt=\"Bing Chen at YouTube\" style=\"width:80%;height:80%;\"vertical-align:middle\"> *<p align=\"center\">Bing Chen at YouTube. Source: Huffington Post.</p>*\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n**What made you want to do creative writing?** \n\nI am absolutely thrilled that I did creative writing; it was probably the most useful thing I could have done. I, like everyone else in the liberal arts school, thought I needed to go to Wharton to get a job and gain useful skills. But, my advisor told me to look fundamentally at how you operate and think as a person, and then find a major that best suits that. \n\nThe problem with majoring in something too practical when you're 18 to 22 is that you’re compartmentalizing yourself in a box before you've even figured out what you want to put in a box. And ever since I was young, I really gravitated towards abstraction and metaphysical ideas. There are very few majors that enable you to leverage abstraction and make it into something useful. \n\nSecondarily, if you look at the people who run the entertainment industry, the overwhelming percentage of them majored in English. The third reason was the fact that there's always graduate school and the real world. \n\n>==Finding the opportunity to engage in real liberal arts in the real world is much harder, whereas you absolutely have an opportunity in finance and operations. You better milk these four years because you literally will not get an opportunity again to engage in something like this.== \n\nThe final reason was that it was really easy. There were nine to ten classes, and I know it sounds like a lazy comment, but one of the reasons I chose Penn was because it’s so *interdisciplinary*. Elon Musk is one of the best examples of an output of interdisciplinary thinking. So I took a lot of psychology, marketing, East Asian Studies, and politics classes — and I would not have been able to do that if I were in a dual degree program or in a more rigid major. It gave me the flexibility to do that. How do I use that today? I use my English major in the way I think every single day, every single second. English is really about creating something from scratch, and doing it in a really compelling way. \n\n<img src= \"https://edtosavetheworld.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/interdisciplinary-learning.png\" alt=\"Interdiscplinary\" style=\"width:50%;height:50%;\"vertical-align:middle\"> *<p align=\"center\"> Source: edtosavetheworld.com.</p>*\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n**How did you make the fact that you were an English major, and not in Wharton, an advantage?**\n\nI did OCR (On-Campus Recruiting) in the fall because I wanted to try it and be exposed to that world. I did not get an interview for Google. But, the day of interviews, you can submit a cover letter and resume, and if someone drops out, Google calls you and gives you a few hours to prepare to interview. I was a back-up. I walked into the room, and it's all my marketing and management friends. One of them benevolently said, “What are you doing here?”\n\nThat fall semester, I was the *only one* to be accepted into the Executive Management program at Google. Usually the entering class for that program is 30 people, but due to the recession, it was 7. So not only was it competitive at Penn, but, globally, it was even more competitive. And I got in as an English major. If you look and sound like everyone else, then you will be suffocated by everyone else and you will disappear. Companies, especially companies that are as progressive as Google, want distinct thinkers. \n\n>==Across tech and media, increasingly your major has little to nothing to do with what you end up doing when you graduate. In the end, it's much more about how you think and if you can deliver.== \n\n\n<img src=\"http://sites.psu.edu/prisrclblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/660/2013/02/pic-1.gif\" alt=\"English Major\" style=\"width:60%;height:60%;\"vertical-align:middle\"> *<p align=\"center\">\"Perks of Being an English Major\" Comic by Jacob Andrews. Source: ForLackofABetterComic.com.</p>*\n\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n**What is something you think most students overlook when they’re at Penn?**\n\n>==Number one: take advantage of the professors.== \n\nI was getting more advice for creative business with professors at Penn. People forget that the professors at Penn are world-class experts in their field. They have incredible connections and the reality is that they are incentivized to help you as you are a talented person. They want to find the next person to lead. When you start in college, have them be like advisers. \n\n>==Secondly, I wish I started a business in college.==\n\n*Editor's note: Some Penn resources for starting a business can be found [here](https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/get-started/).*\n\nI know everyone thinks, “Oh I'm so exhausted, it's been so hard.” But the real world is ten times worse. So if there is ever the time to try something new, whether it's to write a play or start a business, it’s college. I took four or five classes for most semesters because I wanted to do other stuff, and I think that was great. (*Editor's note: Check out this article on [how to start a startup at Penn](https://medium.com/@dormroomfund/how-to-start-a-startup-the-university-of-pennsylvania-9784c1d141b2).*)\n\nThere’s also this thing called the [Counseling and Psychological Services](https://www.vpul.upenn.edu/caps/appointment.php), and I say all Penn students should go there. It's FREE. The majority of people who went to class are those who are just high-achieving people who are stressed out. They're not people who are suicidal or have bipolar disorder and I'm not trying to say that people are crazy because we're all crazy. But again, people are high-achievers who are just exhausted. \n\n>==Going to CAPS can help shape an amazing foundation psychologically for you before you enter the real world.== \n\nThere are a lot of hidden resources. There are a lot of [fellowships](https://www.curf.upenn.edu/fellowships). There are a lot of [research grants](https://www.curf.upenn.edu/research-grants). A lot of hacking competitions and programs (like [PennApps](http://pennapps.com/)). So you can leverage this for your own company, play, or project. Now I want it to be very clear about this — I'm not saying you need to join an organization. In fact, most of them are only useful for making new friends, which is useful but not the result. \n\n>==There are a lot of programs that most people don't know about, or whatever that’s useful to you when you start your own thing. It's simply a matter of asking where those are, and taking advantage of them.==\n\n**Read on for [Part 2](http://thesign.al/bing-chen-on-the-penn-experience-part-ii/): Bing's favorite professors at Penn and how he dealt with pressure from his parents.**\n\n---\n\n*Header photo courtesy of Bing Chen's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/BingChen).*\n\n[![](/content/images/2017/02/mail-icon-wide-white-7.png)](mailto:writers+bing_chen1@thesign.al)",

He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, majoring in English and minoring in psychology and marketing.

First, Professor **[Angela Duckworth](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/angela-duckworth)** and Professor [Martin Seligman](https://penncoursereview.com/instructor/1033-MARTIN-E--P--SELIGMAN), both of whom focus on positive psychology ([PSYC 266](http://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/sites/ppc.sas.upenn.edu/files/duckworth2014positivepsychology.pdf)). \n\nSecond, Professor **[Adam Grant](https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/grantad/)**: I've had dinner with him before, I’ve sat in lecture, and I wish I had taken his class. I completely understand why he’s the highest rated Professor at Wharton. (*Editor's note: Grant teachers [Organizational Behavior](https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT238) under the Management department.*) \n\n<img src= \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/55455_duckworthf.jpg \" style=\"width:80%;height:80%;\"vertical-align:middle\"> *<p align=\"center\"> Angela Duckworth and Adam Grant. \nSource: Helen Fetaw / The Daily Pennsylvanian.</p>*\n\nIn English, Professor **[Paul K. Saint-Amour](https://www.english.upenn.edu/people/paul-k-saint-amour)** was my favorite. He taught me how powerful it is to be able to speak and write beautifully. That man can speak and synthesize abstraction like no one I've ever met. Everything comes down to storytelling. You think about why cave paintings matter, how people reiterate the success and failures of wars — all of that is storytelling. He showed me the most prime version of that. \n\nThen, I’d say Professor **[Peter Decherney](https://cinemastudies.sas.upenn.edu/people/PeterDecherney)** is amazing. He teaches in the Cinema Studies Department. I think he's one of the foremost thinkers on fair use law which in the entertainment industry is the biggest issue right now. You have someone who's literally shaping billions of dollars worth of lawsuits and is in the Cinema Studies department. \n\nAnother one is Professor Charles Dwyer. He taught a course called “Managing People.” It’s a graduate studies class in the Annenberg School for Communication. He was the head of the Executive Education Program in Wharton. So even if he's not teaching I would look at someone else who does. He will teach you [how to manipulate people](https://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/thought-leadership/wharton-at-work/2012/12/increase-your-influence) like no one else will. \n\nMore importantly, he teaches you how you think about your own purpose in life and how to manifest it. That class changed my life. If I would isolate a single class that I found most valuable, it would be that, and no one knows about it because it’s a graduate level class.(*Editor's note: This class doesn't seem to exist anymore. But there are many other graduate-level classes that are available to undergrads.*)\n\n**What was your favorite extracurricular activity?** \n\nThe [Ivy Council](www.ivycouncil.org) was by far my favorite thing, and the reason why is because we were basically building an international enterprise. I forged official partnerships with the Chinese government union, and we created an exchange program where the student government leaders of the Ivy League meet with the student government leaders in China. In China, student leaders are direct feeders into the actual government. So really, the people we met with are going to be running the country some day. We know the vice chairman of the biggest media company there. \n\nThis program exists today, so it's a decade-long program. We were doing real work that has real impact, like professional entities instead of working on a small college level. It was global. That by far was my favorite. I'm convinced that experience is what got me my job [at Google].\n\n**Could you touch on your internship experiences?**\n\nI learned a lot of skills during a summer that I worked doing the creative development of feature films for Disney. It was amazing because I got to learn and observe how the industry works. My last project was Frozen — at the time it was called The Snow Queen — and that really taught me an appreciation for how cool and careful traditional filmmaking was. In fact, it’s the exact opposite of how tech works and then I realized that's exactly what I do *not* want to do when I graduate. I realized in that system, I would be a servant for six years and then maybe at most be a manager. In tech, I could go build something from scratch tomorrow. \n\nI care about creativity more than ever now. But I don't want to go to the traditional system when I graduate. That was basically the lesson. \n\n<div id=\"5\"></div>\n**One of my friends also wants to do creative writing, except her parents want her to do pre-med or pre-law. When you decided to study English, did you face any backlash?** \n\nMy parents are typical immigrant Americans. They both literally came from nothing. My father became CFO of Philips; my mother became CFO of the biggest sign-making company in the world. They’re very conservative because they came from nothing. When you're a person of color and in my mother’s case, a woman of color, you have to try twice as hard to get half as much. Of course, they did not approve of me wanting to become Walt Disney, go into entertainment, and major in English. What I did was this: I didn't listen to them. \n\nThey thought I was in political science until I got my Google job. \n>==Don’t bend to them [your parents] because then you compromise your own dream. Have them bend to you. You have to realize it’s your life.== \n \nAnd at the end of the day, when they say they want you to go to law school or med school, what they mean is they want you to be safe, successful, and happy.  They just don't know how that manifests for you. Once you find that success — and you will find it if you persist — they will understand that happiness and success means something different for you. \n\nI wanted to do something different, and when you do something that's different there’s a fear that comes with that. It’s the fear that, if you fail, there will be no one to catch you. So I had to get over that too. Honestly, the best thing I can tell you is to look at why you’re fundamentally doing something. If you're willing to die for it, then it's the right thing to do. \n\n>==Secondly, remember that everyone who came before you were no more talented or smarter than you are. The only distinction between them and you is that they actually went for it and they did it. Persistence is the only thing that separates those of us who are great from those who just lived.== \n\n<img src= \"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/eb/f6/dcebf6a3d322d6aa27972e3b454fd81b--career-inspiration-motivation-inspiration.jpg \" style=\"width:80%;height:80%;\"vertical-align:middle\"> *<p align=\"center\"> Source: Pinterest.</p>*\n\n\n---\n\n*Header photo courtesy of Bing Chen's [Instagram](www.instagram.com/BingChen).*\n\n[![](/content/images/2017/02/mail-icon-wide-white-7.png)](mailto:writers+bing_chen2@thesign.al)\n",

How did you know you wanted to be a software engineer?**\n\nI knew since I started programming. My mother was an engineer who went to Penn Engineering as well, and she had forced me in high school to take one programming class before I graduated. I signed up and took it freshman year to get it out of the way, and ended up just really loving it. I loved building stuff and being able to create - it was just something that was very different. I feel like the rest of school was memorizing something, learning an equation, solving and applying it, and programming was something very different. It was actually constructing a design something new and that really appealed to me. \n\n**What prompted you to switch jobs?**\n\nI worked at Google for three years. It was a great experience, but I ultimately left because I didn't want to be a software developer full-time. I loved programming, but I liked being able to do more than one thing all day. So I left to join a start-up and then eventually started my own thing. \n\n**Is that what prompted you to get your MBA? To get more advice on how to be more entrepreneurial?**\n\nI was already writing my business plan and wasn't expecting it to be a full-time thing at that point in time. I think an MBA is a useful way to generate a more diverse network. It's very easy in the tech industry to build a great network of engineers and of other founders, and an MBA offers you more connections. \n\nIf I need an expert in retail who specifically worked with manufacturing in India, I can find somebody in my network who has that connection. An MBA gives you a big boost in terms of network and credibility. It gave me a lot of exposure to different businesses and a better ability now to pattern match things and look at a business idea and say “this is flawed for this reason.”\n\n---\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n\n**As you said earlier, you wanted to do more than just one thing. This is something that a lot of undergrads think about: should they specialize and be amazing at one thing or should they be a jack of all trades? What is your perspective on that?**\n\nFor me, it's more of a personal thing. If I had to do one thing all day, programming would probably be the thing I'd most like to do. But, if I had to do one thing all the time, my enthusiasm would drop. Being an engineer all day is not something that I'd ultimately be successful at. I'm best when I'm doing a lot of different things and multitasking. \n\nFor other people, I think you can build a great career either way. There's a lot of room for specialists who are really great at machine learning or something like that. There's also a lot of room, specifically at smaller companies, for people who are good at juggling multiple things and you can really build a fantastic career too. The one thing I would encourage people against is needlessly specializing. There are some people who think \"I need a specialty\" and then they try to pick one, and that's great if they ultimately end up loving it but it's a very risky strategy because they might not and now they're stuck with it.\n\n>==Let the specialty come to you. If you're passionate about that something, go pursue that passion, but don't pick a specialty because you think you should pick one. That will ultimately hurt you.==\n\n**Students here get stressed about only having 4 years to figure that out. What’s your advice for those who still don’t know after graduation?**\n\nI think, for instance, if you're an engineer, you don't have to stay in any one place for a long period of time. I went to Google as a software engineer knowing that I wouldn't stay there forever, and that's totally fine. One of the values of going down the jack-of-all-trades route is that you can always specialize down the road if you wanted to. It's important for people to develop a good foundation in their career. One of the things Google did is it demonstrated proof that I understand how to code, whereas if I went to an unknown company, that would be much less true.\n\n**Knowing that you didn't want to be a software engineer your entire life, was being a writer something that had always been in the back of your mind?** \n\nNo, not at all. I write because that's a way of educating people, disseminating information, and making money but writing is not particularly a calling for me. \n\n<a href=\"#6\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span>*Back to \"Stories Worth Noting\"*</span></a>\n\n---\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n**Your \"Cracking\" career series is so widely read now among students recruiting. What spurred the idea to write them?**\n\n![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-81e959238a39d9eb5d5c9a685e69d76d)\n\nI already ran [CareerCup](https://www.careercup.com/), which was a forum for interview questions, so I wrote a small interview guide to help people, and people really liked it. I realized I really like teaching, and one thing that was great at Penn was that I got to experience teaching [as a CIS TA]. So writing the book, to me, is a lot more about teaching than it is about writing. \n\n**What were the motivations behind CareerCup?**\n\nI started CareerCup after I graduated from Penn. It started with a word document of interview questions and I posted that online and it just grew from there. When I was a TA at Penn, I had a lot of students who were younger than me and looked to me for interview and career advice. So I created the doc to take the knowledge I had from interviewing and give it to them.\n\n<a href=\"#6\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span>*Back to \"Stories Worth Noting\"*</span></a>\n\n---\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n\n**It's awesome to hear that you started this as early as at Penn. How can current students also build up that open knowledge-sharing culture?**\n\nIt starts with each person doing what they can to get that. I think most people are pretty happy to help out, so the best way is to offer ways for people to help and for younger people to reach out and ask for help. A lot of people don't know how to help. The Computer Science program has a pretty active Facebook group [CIS@Penn] for Penn people looking for advice, talking about the curriculum, etc. It's a great group for allowing people to get help and give back as well. Just understand that you don't make fun of people for asking dumb questions. Everybody has dumb questions and that's not a question of them being dumb.\n\n**I've realized that sometimes student mentors have this feeling that being only a year or two older than their mentee, they may not have the right advice to give. How do you overcome that?**\n\n>==What helped me is realizing that everybody feels like they don't know enough. Everybody has this imposter syndrome, that they don't feel like they know enough or that they got lucky.==\n\nJust realizing that this is pretty much universal. Given that, logically you’re feeling like you’re not good enough to give people advice has nothing to do with you actually not-being-good-enough. You're a junior mentoring a freshman. You learned a lot in those two years, and it's hard sometimes to quantify it. So it's easy for people to think that they haven't learned that much. But that advice, even though it's just one perspective, is still really useful for people. \n\n<a href=\"#6\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span>*Back to \"Stories Worth Noting\"*</span></a>\n\n---\n<div id=\"4\"></div>\n\n**Do you have a favorite Penn moment or memory that has been very influential to your career path today?**\n\nOne of the most influential things was being a TA for what's now called CIS260 with Max Mintz. That was super useful. It not only gave me a foundation in a lot of computer science concepts that I needed, but it also gave me a ton of experience in public speaking and explaining new stuff to people. \n\nFrankly, I think public speaking should be required in colleges. Almost nobody gets enough experience with it. Teaching is one way - if you can teach a section, that's really good. I don’t know that a typical TA shift in which you're just answering questions one-on-one is as valuable. That doesn’t give you a lot of public speaking experience. But if you get to teach a section, it's an incredibly useful experience. Otherwise, speech and debate teams can be really useful, as well as taking a class that has a big public speaking component.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XbkreMh.png\n\" alt=\"Gayle McDowell's Penn Engineering Masters 2016 Commencement Address\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%\">*<p align=\"center\">Gayle giving Penn Engineering Masters 2016 Commencement Address.</p>*\n\nThe thing with public speaking is that it's something that probably scares most people, but it's going to be so important later in your career. But by then, it's going to be hard for you to learn it when it's needed. When you're 40 and all of a sudden need to go speak at a bunch of conferences, you can't take time off to learn how to do that. And so learning it while you're in college is really important. *Editor's note: Penn offers several public speaking courses, workshops, and resources for students, [found here](https://www.college.upenn.edu/public-speaking).*\n\n**There are quite a few teaching opportunities for students now. For example, there are CIS half credits that are taught exclusively by students.**\n\nI actually started those classes! \n\n**Oh sweet! How did you start them?**\n\nI started a class that was just a software development class. This was before the half-credit classes existed. I started somewhat secretly and circumvented certain things around the administration. I did that for two years and then turned it over to another student to teach the following year after I graduated. Once we had several years of proof that students can teach classes and bad things will not happen, the administration actually put this as an official part of the program. *Editor's Note: CIS half-credits offered today include Python, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and mobile development. Check out [all of them here](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis19x/).*\n\n**Do you think the education of the future is students taking more of the initiative to teach other students, rather than relying on standardized education?**\n\nYeah, it's definitely important. \n>==I realized that there will always be a disconnect between what professors teach and what you need to learn. Professors are researchers. They are not professional developers. And there is value in learning a bit about each, so people have to learn from some resources other than their professors.==\n\nI think the half-credit classes are awesome, but the other thing is students taking the initiative to learn themselves, and not expecting the curriculum to deliver the right education for them because it won't. Hackathons, like PennApps, is one great tool for getting kids to learn programing. One of the big weaknesses in the curriculum, which has largely been addressed now, has been a lack of practical experience, and that was what I wanted my independent class to do: give people practical programming experience. *Editor's note: [PennApps](http://pennapps.com/) is the original and largest college hackathon, held every semester at Penn. It features a competition, beginner workshops, and a career fair.*\n\n<a href=\"#6\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span>*Back to \"Stories Worth Noting\"*</span></a>\n\n---\n<div id=\"5\"></div>\n\n**Computer science is now one of the most popular majors at Penn. But one issue is the steep learning curve seems to turn away non-major students who just want to try it out. What can we do to help make them more accessible?**\n\nFirst of all, one of the things that makes these classes inaccessible is that you have people who have a lot more knowledge of programming taking these classes. And then you also have a culture where people don't want to admit to struggling, and everybody acts like it's easy for them. We should focus more on recognition and making it more normal to admit that you're struggling, and for juniors and seniors who are doing okay to talk about how they struggled. \n\nSecond, there should be more opportunities in the early classes for catch-up. One of the things that I saw a lot of when I was a student was that in the freshmen classes, new people who got stuck in the first homework assignment or two but didn't want to fail cheated and copied somebody else's homework. And when the next assignment comes in, it's cumulative and they don't have the background do it and so they cheat again. By the time they realize how much education is lost, they don't have the ability to catch up anymore. So offering more ways for people to catch up with gaps in their own education is helpful.\n\n**Lastly, to take this beyond the classroom setting: What’s the best way for non-technical people to succeed in today’s tech landscape?**\n\nIt's nice for people who are in tech to have programmed before, but that doesn't mean you have to be a good programmer. ‘Having programmed before’ could be you doing the 10-hour workshop on Codecademy. You don't have to like programming, you don't have to be good at it, but learning a bit can be useful so you at least get over your fear of ‘I don't really know what programming is.’\n\nBeyond that, do things to show initiative. The tech industry as a whole really values that. If building an app is too intimidating for you, which it is for a lot of people, there are other ways of showing initiative without necessarily being technical. What I value are people who have started a club, created a blog, or ran a group that has raised money for some charity. That shows initiative.\n\n<a href=\"#6\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span>*Back to \"Stories Worth Noting\"*</span></a>\n\n---\n\n***From the Editor:***\n*Gayle's Cracking the PM Interview has been instrumental in helping me and countless friends prep for the jobs and internships we have today.

How did you know you wanted to be a software engineer?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I knew since I started programming. My mother was an engineer who went to Penn Engineering as well, and she had forced me in high school to take one programming class before I graduated. I signed up and took it freshman year to get it out of the way, and ended up just really loving it. I loved building stuff and being able to create - it was just something that was very different. I feel like the rest of school was memorizing something, learning an equation, solving and applying it, and programming was something very different. It was actually constructing a design something new and that really appealed to me. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What prompted you to switch jobs?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I worked at Google for three years. It was a great experience, but I ultimately left because I didn't want to be a software developer full-time. I loved programming, but I liked being able to do more than one thing all day. So I left to join a start-up and then eventually started my own thing. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Is that what prompted you to get your MBA? To get more advice on how to be more entrepreneurial?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I was already writing my business plan and wasn't expecting it to be a full-time thing at that point in time. I think an MBA is a useful way to generate a more diverse network. It's very easy in the tech industry to build a great network of engineers and of other founders, and an MBA offers you more connections. </p>\n\n<p>If I need an expert in retail who specifically worked with manufacturing in India, I can find somebody in my network who has that connection. An MBA gives you a big boost in terms of network and credibility. It gave me a lot of exposure to different businesses and a better ability now to pattern match things and look at a business idea and say “this is flawed for this reason.”</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n\n<p><strong>As you said earlier, you wanted to do more than just one thing. This is something that a lot of undergrads think about: should they specialize and be amazing at one thing or should they be a jack of all trades? What is your perspective on that?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For me, it's more of a personal thing. If I had to do one thing all day, programming would probably be the thing I'd most like to do. But, if I had to do one thing all the time, my enthusiasm would drop. Being an engineer all day is not something that I'd ultimately be successful at. I'm best when I'm doing a lot of different things and multitasking. </p>\n\n<p>For other people, I think you can build a great career either way. There's a lot of room for specialists who are really great at machine learning or something like that. There's also a lot of room, specifically at smaller companies, for people who are good at juggling multiple things and you can really build a fantastic career too. The one thing I would encourage people against is needlessly specializing. There are some people who think \"I need a specialty\" and then they try to pick one, and that's great if they ultimately end up loving it but it's a very risky strategy because they might not and now they're stuck with it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>Let the specialty come to you. If you're passionate about that something, go pursue that passion, but don't pick a specialty because you think you should pick one. That will ultimately hurt you.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Students here get stressed about only having 4 years to figure that out. What’s your advice for those who still don’t know after graduation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think, for instance, if you're an engineer, you don't have to stay in any one place for a long period of time. I went to Google as a software engineer knowing that I wouldn't stay there forever, and that's totally fine. One of the values of going down the jack-of-all-trades route is that you can always specialize down the road if you wanted to. It's important for people to develop a good foundation in their career. One of the things Google did is it demonstrated proof that I understand how to code, whereas if I went to an unknown company, that would be much less true.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Knowing that you didn't want to be a software engineer your entire life, was being a writer something that had always been in the back of your mind?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>No, not at all. I write because that's a way of educating people, disseminating information, and making money but writing is not particularly a calling for me. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"#6\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span><em>Back to \"Stories Worth Noting\"</em></span></a></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n<p><strong>Your \"Cracking\" career series is so widely read now among students recruiting.

What is the reality of entrepreneurship that students should know about?**\n\nThe first thing is that dropping out doesn't mean you become the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates. Those are the rare outliers. This also doesn't mean that it's a very risky move and that you will end up on the streets. The reality is somewhere in between. And it varies from person to person. I don't recommend this path for everyone. \n\nFor me and my two partners, it makes sense because firstly, we were on scholarships which means that we were bound to the government for at least six years. By the time we get out, we would be thirty years old, and a good part of our youth would be already spent in government service. \n\n>==There are not a lot of transferable skills if you want to pursue entrepreneurship. If you want to do something, just do it directly because usually there's no substitute for it.==\n\nEntrepreneurship is one great example because the kind of skills required is so unique you can't get it from any other experiences. \n\nSecond, by the time we went to college we already had a bit of a customer base and some traction going for us. We managed to raise funding. \n \nThird, I really just enjoyed what I had experienced in the few months before I'd started school. I like Penn, I like the students, and I like the people, but it doesn’t compare to entrepreneurship. I think the biggest risk for a lot of people starting entrepreneurship is that reality doesn't match up to expectations. So only if you have dipped your toes in the water before and you know exactly how much pain it can cost you and you know it’s not as glamorous it seems, and even after that you decide entrepreneurship is for you, then I'd recommend it. If you know what you're getting into, then this is a decision that you can make. Otherwise, I don’t recommend the decision.\n\nWhat we are doing here at Glints is very exciting. Glints is growing and expanding to new markets. I see it being far more exciting than continuing my college education. College is fine, but I can always go back. \n \n**You said that for entrepreneurship, there are no transferable skills. Can you elaborate on that?**\n\nIt is very difficult for you to pick up the skills you need to be an entrepreneur via any other path. Because I was supposed to work for a sovereign wealth firm, I thought the financial analysis skills could be helpful for startups. But I realized those very specialized skills are actually just a small part because when you are an entrepreneur, you have to take care of everything. \n\n>==What's more important is the kind of mindset and traits that you develop as an entrepreneur. Traits like being very resourceful, being very gritty, sticking to one thing for very long. These are not skills you can pick up from any other profession. These are traits that you have to develop.==  \n\nAnd most of them you can only develop through entrepreneurship. Maybe you can develop a bit of it through other activities such as running a marathon to develop grit, but if you want to have the full set of traits, I think entrepreneurship is the only way to do it. \n\nThe kind of network and connections you get is quite special. Knowing investors is one thing, but there are different types of investors; the investors you meet as a banker might not be useful when you're an entrepreneur. \n\n <div id=\"3\"></div>\n\n**Do you still see any value in college?**\n\nI think college has its place. I believe that life operates in cycles. \n\nHow most people operate is they front-load the theoretical and academic learning in their early twenties, and then they go work for the rest of their lives and retire. But I believe it’s healthier and more effective if you break them up into cycles. You study for a few years, then you apply it and try to achieve results in the real world in the next few years. After that you take a break for a little while, and then you repeat the cycle but for a different topic. This is the kind of rhythm I want to pursue for the rest of my life. Maybe I'll go back to finish up my bachelor degree and put whatever I have learned into practice, maybe in the next start-up. Then take a few years off and maybe go for a Masters. I don’t want my life to be linear like how we have been taught in life. \n\n![alt](http://www.brandsworld.com.sg/content/dam/brands/sg/fuel-a-better-me/glints/glints-ful-culture-v1.jpg)\n\n*Ying (left) & Glints Team. \nSource: http://www.brandsworld.com.sg/*\n\n**If you look back over the past few years, what would you say are the major milestones? The highs and lows?** \n \nWe raised series A last year.  This is a major milestone for me emotionally, not simply because we raised the funds, but because we were really close to shutting the business down since we were running out of cash. We were facing a lot of problems internally and we thought that the startup was not going to go on. A lot of employees were losing faith in the business. \n\nThe three of us had a chat and we decided we are not going to let this business fail, that we're going to push on no matter what. Then we started taking massive action to make things happen, and we eventually closed the round. \n \nWe also managed to raise our lead revenue to a point where the business was no longer dying, where it was actually much healthier. Before, we were relying on some government policies to sell our products and the policy changed literally overnight without any pre-warning, which cut off one of our main sources of revenue, causing us to lose a lot of money in a short period of time. As you know, cash flow is king especially in a startup, and that nearly killed us. So raising series A made us survive for another day. That was emotionally a triumph for me. \n \nA milestone for us on the on the product side was expanding. Singapore has been a very comfortable, but limited market. Expanding to Indonesia, setting up a team there and closing our first series there made it clear to us that we are finally becoming a regional business. \n \nWhen we were running out cash, the three of us had to put money into the company to keep it going and pay salaries for the end of the month. It was not only financially stressful but also emotionally because we felt like we were letting our parents down. I felt like I made the wrong decision to give up our schools and scholarships for an idea that is unproven. \n \n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n**Do you have anything else you would like to share with students?** \n\nMy advice to students would be my advice for myself three years ago, or when I started at Penn: Don't be afraid to explore the world and don't be afraid to be vulnerable and expose yourself to different domains.\n\nI have been out for three years in the wild and interacting with the wildest groups of people. I realized the world is a lot different and a lot bigger than I have ever imagined. Growing up in Singapore under the academic system, I found myself always interacting with the same kind of people who do well in school and come from good family backgrounds, then eventually end up in the same jobs. When you put your eyes out there and start talking to people who are vastly different from you but also impressive in their own ways, then you realize: \n\n>==Wow, actually, you can live your life in a very different way and still find a lot of meaning in what you do.== \n\nSo my advice is don’t be afraid to explore in terms of your career. \n\nOne of my mentors gave me this advice: \n\n>==When you go out for your career, you have to know very clearly whether you are there to earn or if you are there to learn, because usually those two don’t go together.==\n\nYou have to be clear where you are at, so I would recommend for most students that their first job out of college should be to learn, and once they’ve learned enough, earn. It's never too late to earn and you've got a long life ahead of you. \n\n***Editor's Note:*** *Please feel free to email me at schuhan@wharton.upenn.edu if you have any questions for YC or in general!*",

After that you take a break for a little while, and then you repeat the cycle but for a different topic. This is the kind of rhythm I want to pursue for the rest of my life. Maybe I'll go back to finish up my bachelor degree and put whatever I have learned into practice, maybe in the next start-up. Then take a few years off and maybe go for a Masters. I don’t want my life to be linear like how we have been taught in life. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://www.brandsworld.com.sg/content/dam/brands/sg/fuel-a-better-me/glints/glints-ful-culture-v1.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Ying (left) &amp; Glints Team. \nSource: <a href=\"http://www.brandsworld.com.sg/\">http://www.brandsworld.com.sg/</a></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>If you look back over the past few years, what would you say are the major milestones? The highs and lows?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>We raised series A last year.  This is a major milestone for me emotionally, not simply because we raised the funds, but because we were really close to shutting the business down since we were running out of cash. We were facing a lot of problems internally and we thought that the startup was not going to go on. A lot of employees were losing faith in the business. </p>\n\n<p>The three of us had a chat and we decided we are not going to let this business fail, that we're going to push on no matter what. Then we started taking massive action to make things happen, and we eventually closed the round. </p>\n\n<p>We also managed to raise our lead revenue to a point where the business was no longer dying, where it was actually much healthier. Before, we were relying on some government policies to sell our products and the policy changed literally overnight without any pre-warning, which cut off one of our main sources of revenue, causing us to lose a lot of money in a short period of time. As you know, cash flow is king especially in a startup, and that nearly killed us. So raising series A made us survive for another day. That was emotionally a triumph for me. </p>\n\n<p>A milestone for us on the on the product side was expanding. Singapore has been a very comfortable, but limited market. Expanding to Indonesia, setting up a team there and closing our first series there made it clear to us that we are finally becoming a regional business. </p>\n\n<p>When we were running out cash, the three of us had to put money into the company to keep it going and pay salaries for the end of the month. It was not only financially stressful but also emotionally because we felt like we were letting our parents down. I felt like I made the wrong decision to give up our schools and scholarships for an idea that is unproven. </p>\n\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have anything else you would like to share with students?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>My advice to students would be my advice for myself three years ago, or when I started at Penn: Don't be afraid to explore the world and don't be afraid to be vulnerable and expose yourself to different domains.</p>\n\n<p>I have been out for three years in the wild and interacting with the wildest groups of people. I realized the world is a lot different and a lot bigger than I have ever imagined. Growing up in Singapore under the academic system, I found myself always interacting with the same kind of people who do well in school and come from good family backgrounds, then eventually end up in the same jobs. When you put your eyes out there and start talking to people who are vastly different from you but also impressive in their own ways, then you realize: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>Wow, actually, you can live your life in a very different way and still find a lot of meaning in what you do.</mark> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my advice is don’t be afraid to explore in terms of your career. </p>\n\n<p>One of my mentors gave me this advice: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><mark>When you go out for your career, you have to know very clearly whether you are there to earn or if you are there to learn, because usually those two don’t go together.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You have to be clear where you are at, so I would recommend for most students that their first job out of college should be to learn, and once they’ve learned enough, earn. It's never too late to earn and you've got a long life ahead of you. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Editor's Note:</em></strong> <em>Please feel free to email me at schuhan@wharton.upenn.edu if you have any questions for YC or in general!</em></p>",
