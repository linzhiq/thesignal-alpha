You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.\\n\\n\\n## Basic tagging\\n\\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with `News` and other posts with `Cycling`, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on `/tag/news/` and `/tag/cycling/`, respectively.\\n\\nIf you tag a post with both `News` *and* `Cycling` - then it appears in both sections.\\n\\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.\\n\\n\\n## The primary tag\\n\\nInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default.

Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company based in San Francisco, California.\\n\\n*Editor: Jackie was one of the alums I met on my [Wharton Industry Exploration Program (WIEP)](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep/) trip to San Francisco this January. During the visit to Square, she spoke mainly of her own career development and aptitude for understanding relationships and people. One line that I resonated strongly with was that after landing her first banking job, she felt her hard work had culminated into a career all of her friends wanted, but not so much herself. Even after leading one of the top hedge funds in the world, her overarching passion for people and entrepreneurship ultimately sparked her change to tech.*\\n\\n--------\\n\\n###### Tell me about your career path and the various changes.\\n \\nI started off at Goldman Sachs doing M&A and then worked in private equity both at Goldman and a large firm. For a while, there were benefits of working there [at Goldman Sachs] as it was an entrepreneurial private partnership and maintained the dynamics of a smaller firm at the time.  I enjoyed investing — it was an intense way to learn finance as it’s a high stakes business to put your own capital to work behind your ideas.\\n \\nI later left Goldman to pursue a more entrepreneurial path. I was an investor for over 20 years and it became boring and routine in an institutional environment.  I thought tech was incredibly interesting, and I had a unique vantage point since I had spent years investing and thinking about tech business models.  I also focused on the people working in the company, and I thought Marissa Mayer and the situation at Yahoo was unique and challenging. *Editor's note: Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, had asked Jackie to work with her as the Chief Development Officer.*\\n \\n###### Was there a specific experience that made you consider Square?\\n \\nIn the late 1990s, I was trying to raise two million dollars for a friend. He owned a boutique in Atlanta and Charleston, which became Jeffrey in the meatpacking district. I realized it's very hard for entrepreneurs to raise capital even with fantastic ideas and a track record. Square reminded me of that experience and of my family’s businesses in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. I can tangentially see how the work of our team can help American small business.\\n \\n \\n###### What are some soft or technical skills to be most successful in this type of career?\\n \\nI find financial analysis skills helpful for looking at business plans. Accounting — not so helpful.

Danny created BioBots's core product, a 3D living tissue printer, while he was a student at Penn. \\n\\n*Editor: A curious group at Penn which I was a part had been closely following the revolution in synthetic biology. We felt biology and life was becoming as exciting as personal computing in the 1980s. Danny Cabrera was at the center of all the excitement. We met with him to unfold his vision for a society where life can be engineered like everything else, and the story behind how he became enamored with an idea called BioBots.* \\n\\n*This interview was conducted by Rajiv Patel O’Connor, a cofounder of The Sign.al currently on sabbatical in San Francisco*\\n\\n--------\\n\\n###### What is your background. Describe the path that has led you to where you are.\\n\\nWhen I started college, I was really interested in science fiction. I was motivated by it and excited about the cool things described in science fiction novels. I totally bought into the idea or premise that to survive or to extend the lifetime of humanity, we need get out of Earth and become a multi-planetary species. So when I started going to school and studying math and physics and was thinking that building rockets and stuff was going to be the way or limiting factor of getting to other planets. But quickly, I realized that getting there wasn’t the biggest hurdle: it was what happens when you get there. I started looking for alternatives or other ways that we could terraform planets or even establish human colonies. It was still an intellectual frame of something to think about. It was then that I stumbled into this emerging field of synthetic biology which is the idea of using life as a manufacturing technology to build useful things. It seemed like the ultimate answer.\\n\\nYou could have living things that could help us on other planets. I didn’t know too much biology, but I started getting excited about it and thinking about ways to learn. I started working in a lab in Miami, where I was going to school at the time, doing any kind of research that I could, and it ended up being drug discovery work. I learned a lot about the way we are doing drug discovery and spent a lot of time learning to use pipettes and doing manual biology work under a post-doc. I kinda realized that it was pretty slow and pretty shitty to do everything by hand and also that the way that we are analyzing data is not really automated. So I started working on software to automate a little of the workflow and the process of designing and developing drugs. And then from there, after I graduated, I spent a year and a half working in the lab and then a summer at UC Berkeley learning to integrate some of basic biology with different ways to fabricate miniature devices; it was microfluidics work and I was just interested in how I could begin to combine biology with other hard sciences because biology seemed like a pretty difficult system to model. Building ways to minimize and simplify a little bit could be better and obviously, having digital fabrication tools to do that would only make biology or the way we understand biology more and more robust. From there, I transferred out of the community college and came over to Penn. I was part of the Internationally Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) team competition that is mostly run by undergraduates across the world.\\n\\n###### What is iGEM? \\nEvery year iGem gets together at MIT, and there is a big conference where we compete. It’s basically a project where teams of undergraduates spend the summer designing new organisms. I thought it was pretty sweet way to one, work with others who have similar interests and two, develop a new organism. Our project was really successful. We won first place in North America, but from working in a lab for so long, I learned the problems we were facing and the hurdles that would have to be crossed if we wanted to engineer living things. Some of those is that biology is done in 2D, which is not a good way of modeling a 3D system, which is what our bodies are, and two, biology is really manual and we need tools to automate that. So I had a friend who was working on 3D printing and we blended these two things and built BioBots. And that’s where the real vision for BioBots. The first product was a 3D bio-printer that prints 3D living tissue. It’s digital and it does a 3D thing. It’s really the first step in the process of building tools to empower people to build life.\\n\\n###### What are you doing now?\\n\\nSo we started it my senior year in college and we were building devices on top of a bar here in Philly. We won a PennVention and got a little cash. I was going to get a Ph.D. at Penn with my buddy Ricky D Solorzano. So I was going to go to med school, but we promised ourselves that we could sell a few of these units and get a little more cash. So we’d defer or drop out. We were able to sell our first prototypes to labs around the Philly area which was enough momentum to get us into an accelerator in Philly and get us a little more money, office space, and a ton of great business mentors, which absolutely helped and were instrumental. This was enough to defer out of grad school and with that we designed a beta-program where we built a really early-stage beta unit and we partnered off with fifty of the top researchers across the world. It was extremely successful. We sold all of those units for $5000 and it was enough to keep going and enough traction to raise a seed round. With that money, we started working with these early collaborators, incorporating their feedback into new products and grew out the team and mature the product a lot. It has been a pretty sweet ride. \\n\\nRight now, my main roles are to continue pushing out the product. I’m the main salesman. I’m also, in general, trying to focus the entire team. We have three core technologies: hardware, software, and wetware. I try to make sure all three of those are moving in the same direction and that we’re really pushing out with the technologies we develop, as well as the technology is aligned with the vision really empowering people to do interesting and helpful things using biology.\\n\\n###### How are your personal values aligned with your company values?\\nI have a go-getter attitude and I get motivated by big problems and challenges. I think this gets passed on through everybody else. The problem we’re solving is a pretty ginormous thing. We’re trying to figure how to engineer and design life which is, if not the most, one of the most audacious things one could do. We are pretty uncompromising in that goal and how we go about it. \\n> ==We are extremely hard-working and we all love this idea of how powerful biology is and how we can take control of it and doing incredibly useful things with it. That is the toxic part of this and that’s what’s awesome. We’re definitely all smoking the same thing when we’re talking about that.==\\n\\n###### Advice for people looking to get into biotech startup space?\\nA lot of things I noticed when we were getting into this, we’d end up talking to people working in this biotech world for a while and were entrenched in thinking that that doing business in this space had to be done a certain way. This view was really sort of unappealing and not sort of culturally what I think of how to do business. And instead of listening to them and their advice or cautionary tales, we set out to build the business we wanted and try to change the biotech world to reflect more of what we thought business should be. So in general, listen to your mentors and listen to your advisors, but don’t let them influence you too much.\\n\\n###### What’s the biggest risk you’ve taken?\\nWhat we’re doing is really complex and it’s risky to think that we can do what we’re doing. But for me, the biggest risk was not going the credit-score route. It’s what I was planning on doing most of my undergrad career. And then, after that, going out on a limb and raising money from investors. I think I feel a sense of responsibility to them, to making returns. I don’t know if it’s risky, but it’s added another dimension of responsibility. The biggest thing is making sure the business is continuing to grow quickly because we’ve got a great team of people that are all counting on that happening and the worst thing that could happen is if I let them down. Not just letting myself down for this great, grand vision we want to accomplish, but the investors because they also believe in it, and even more importantly, letting my friends and co-workers down.\\n\\n###### Do you ever feel a responsibility to contribute to something bigger?\\nIt’s hard to think of something bigger than humanity. I don’t just owe it to myself or my coworkers or even my investors, but also to all of humanity, including those who haven’t been born yet.\\n\\n###### What goes through your mind when you’re assembling a team?\\nWe’re a pretty small company, and what we look for is that, one, you believe in what we’re doing. That this future is going to be real and you believe there is going to be a time when we can design living things on our laptops and print them on our desktops. Two, you can really excel in unstructured environment. As a small team, we don’t have managers and we can’t micromanage people, so we really need people who can excel in that environment.\\n\\n###### Where do you hope to be five years from now? Ten years? Twenty years?\\n\\nRight now we’re really focused on making clients happy and delivering a lot of value to them. Them is mainly tissue engineers and material scientists, people trying to build 3D tissues. Five years from now, I see us in a position to enter the general tissue market, and display traditional tissue culture technology. Every lab should be doing biology in 3D. Ten years from, I hope we can automate other parts of the lab. And in twenty years, I hope we are closer to the stream of having a fully automated lab controlled by one student on his laptop. Kind of like writing code.\\n\\n###### What kind of legacy do you want to leave behind?\\nI hope BioBots can inspire other companies to think about the kinds of products they can build that can have an effect on humanity and think about this larger problem of touching and designing and engineering living things and how do we do that. And if that’s the legacy we can leave behind, I don’t think I could be much happier.\\n\\n--------\\n\\n###### Editor's Key Takeaways:\\n1.

I started looking for alternatives or other ways that we could terraform planets or even establish human colonies. It was still an intellectual frame of something to think about.

My grandfather and grandparents on both sides were immigrants who came out from the West Bank and Syria in the mid 1900s. It all started with the traditional American immigrant story. They were washing dishes and bussing tables and got kind of the bare education. They built a business independently and were contrarian in their thinking throughout the life of their career. The mentality in my family is that we don't necessarily care what you do, but what you do you have to be the best at it. \\n\\nAnd so growing up that was something that was really important to me and my extended family. So when I got to Wharton, I had been an entrepreneur in very small terms, I had corralled groups of friends to start projects in high school. While I was at Wharton I was spending most of my time building a nonprofit company for the Middle East that I was really excited about, a micro lending company. And what I noticed was that I was most energized and most passionate when I was actually doing things, learning in tough situations, and putting myself in uncomfortable environments. \\n\\nAnd so my story is a bit less traditional. I ended up dropping after Wharton after sophomore year, I joined a small startup out in San Francisco which had been backed by Sequoia Capital, it was about six people. I ran product for that company for four years. For me, putting myself in really tough situations is kind of the key to making an impact and feeling energized, so I ended up leaving Wharton to pursue that. We ended up building that company into a video technology company called TokBox that we later sold to Telefonica which is one of the largest telecom companies in the world. After that I moved to London and I ran a 6,000 person innovation team for Telefonica. Then that desire to be put in really hard situations and build things from scratch came back so I moved out west and started up Atomic, a venture studio, with some close friends and peers from Wharton that I had known for a long time. We pursued a model which we believed was a much more effective way of allocating capital and building companies. \\n\\n>==So at a high level I think I had been an entrepreneur for a long time. What I always loved doing was putting on shoes which were much bigger than me and seeing if I could fill them.==\\n\\n###### What other paths could you have gone down?\\n\\nNot surprisingly I was looking at investment banking and consulting. It’s really quite difficult to do something like moving to San Francisco when all of my closest friends, peers, and all of the people that I respected were from Wharton and moving to New York. They were working in banking and private equity, and their careers, starting from Wharton, had a fairly linear and expected behavior. \\n\\nYou'd join as an associate, you'd become a vice president, then partner. Then you're 30 years old making this much money and have so-and-so title, it is really quite difficult to say \\\"no” to something so laid out and linear. \\n\\nBut for me I have instinctively been someone who either needs to be the best at what they're doing or do something incredibly interesting. So sophomore year when I was evaluating options at JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc. I knew I didn't have the financial brain to put me in the one percent, I knew I was good but I wasn't the best, and the idea of going down a path that was so laid out for me was really quite constraining. I felt like it kind of sucked all the wind from my sails. It was quite deflating in nature. But then the idea of taking a bet on myself, moving to San Francisco, being in an environment where my success was driven directly by my day-to-day actions and depended on how I did as opposed to a much more linear path that was constrained by a structured environment — to me, that was unbelievably exciting. \\n\\nIt was an opportunity to take a bet on myself, the opportunity to get ahead in many ways, and the opportunity to do something very, very different. And I'm very thankful and blessed that I did that and had great advisors that were able to help me. At that time in the early 2000s, it was not something that people did coming out of Wharton and my hope is that over time this becomes a much more comfortable route for a lot of the smartest brains that we have in that school.\\n\\n###### How did you go about designing your college experience and curriculum based on your specific goals?\\n\\nI took a bit of a non-traditional path. Structured within the management concentration at Wharton I studied venture capital. I was really proactive on day one by surrounding myself with professors that were teaching very relevant courses, trying to get myself into engineering classes around product design and engineering entrepreneurship, and many types of things that weren't really laid out in a traditional concentration back then. The opportunities at Wharton are really quite outstanding, the abilities to dive deep vertically into one specific subject is powerful, and so I put a lot of time into trying to craft the few years there into making them as practically helpful as possible for when I graduated and came back to San Francisco to try and build something.\\n\\n###### What was it about TokBox that you really loved: the technology, team, product, or something else?\\n\\nAt a really high level something I really believe is that you can get excited as an entrepreneur or an operator about a lot of different ideas. Some of the best operators and executives I've ever met mostly like solving hard problems and being surrounded by phenomenally brilliant people more so than they have a strong passion towards an individual industry. So for TokBox it wasn't the video in particular that attracted me. I think video technology at the time was really coming up from a market standpoint and growing rapidly, you had things like ChatRoulette, Microsoft acquiring Skype, Salesforce building out chat experiences, and today you have things like Twitch.tv, Meerket, Periscope and all of these. At the grand level I believed in the market, I believed the technology was valuable and the usage would be growing consistently. What really got me excited though were the people, they were all ex-operators, they were backed by Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Ron Conway at SV Angel, and the board of directors was absolutely brilliant.\\n\\n> ==I was surrounded by people who I knew were smarter than me, people who I'd been researching. I'd learned from them via their blogs and things of that sort for so long already. That's really what got me — the opportunity to learn and be taught and mentored. ==\\n\\n###### Going back to the idea of grit, what were the inflection points at TokBox, specifically the lows of the lows, the most painful moments that you had?\\n\\nThere's probably a couple dozen of them that I could think of. TokBox was in every way the stereotypical Silicon Valley story. Our founders left the company the week before I started, they were having conflicts with the venture community and eventually left. We went through the process of hiring a new CEO and executive team, and a couple years later we pivoted, which is another Silicon Valley thing to do. I had the opportunity to launch dozens of products that failed — I learned all types of things about momentum and people management and expectation management and board management. \\n\\nWe went through a number of rounds of financing — one of which was during 2008, which was a really brutal time to raise capital in the valley. And then we were able to experience a lot of acquisition options that didn't go through and failed, which were close but didn't happen, and then finally, thankfully we were able to land a really phenomenal home for the company and a great exit. If you watch [Silicon Valley](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley) you go through all of those stages of building a company and kind of in a silly way I was able to experience all of those, which was pretty exciting.\\n\\n###### How did you manage your psychology during the rough times you faced in the startup world?\\n\\n>==I mean at the time you want to avoid all the pain but in retrospect what’s clear is that it’s impossible to avoid any of the pain.==\\n\\nBut there are things you can learn and do better time after time which is one of the beautiful aspects of the Atomic model. But the struggles that companies have will always exist. The saying \\\"what doesn't kill you makes your stronger\\\" is 100 percent accurate in the startup world. So when people come to me and say, \\\"I want to be a founder or join a small startup, what do you think?\\\", I always caution them: unless they are really bought into building something, I recommend they should do something else. Those hardships, they'll always be there, it’s often what filters out the best from those who are just good, which is a pretty big distinction. And it’s almost always necessary to build something meaningful.\\n\\n###### When you decided to leave Wharton were you dropping out or was it just another step in exploring options? \\n\\nWharton was really phenomenal in giving me a lot of time to evaluate working in Silicon Valley. They give you the capacity to take a business leave, so I was able to work in San Francisco and then eventually a couple years later was able to graduate, which was phenomenal, while still having that opportunity to explore some more immediate passions. \\n\\n###### Why does Atomic value distribution so much?\\n\\nTwenty years ago when you went to raise venture capital you were physically building something new, like semiconductors or some kind of new technology like cloud that had never been created before and the cost of doing so was exorbitant. The cost of setting up cloud infrastructure ten years ago was probably 100 times as much as it is today. So over time what we saw is that building companies became more of market risk versus technology risk. \\n\\nHistorically it was technology risk. Now really the questions are if something will be adopted, will people love it, will they use it, will they share it with friends, how will they access it, will it be valuable for their business. It’s not a question of if we can actually build it. Some companies obviously are different: AI or self driving cars, some of these are true technology risks, but for the majority of companies and the majority of market cap you see coming out of Silicon Valley these days it’s really market risk — that is really what we spend time on at Atomic. \\n\\nWe ask how you de-risk something, how you evaluate go-to market models, how you test them as much as possible early to really understand exactly what the potential is of the business and how can you use those methods to reinforce and re-educate the product decisions being made early on to get to product market fit early even faster. It is something that is only now possible due to the decreased cost of open source technology and platforms like Twilio and AWS and Heroku and all of these things.\\n\\n###### How do you do effective diligence on your company ideas?\\n\\nOne of the exciting aspects of Atomic is that we do not play in only one market. We don't focus exclusively on healthcare or exclusively on enterprise software businesses. We like to play in a lot of different markets. So of the eight companies that we started in the last couple of years, a couple are consumer internet, a couple are small business direct sales driven, a couple are enterprise, a couple are in healthcare. One of the energizing aspects of the model is that we're able to use many of the patterns that we recognize and apply them into different verticals. \\n\\nWe go through a process of validating ideas. We have a book of about 400 to 500 ideas that could be really great companies. The way we do that is a few fold: one is things that we're excited ourselves to see in the world, that we believe that a company could fix or improve or meaningfully change the behavior of billions of people. Another question is, is this something that could generate a billion dollars in revenue? Could a billion people use this and would it improve their lives? One more thing we think about is what are products, experiences, and opportunities that exclusively wealthy and those with opportunity have had and how can we make those mass market, how can we give to the masses what has once been only available to those in the one percent? \\n\\nThat’s something when you think of a company like Uber was really a driving force — being able in one click to have a limo arrive was something that was once just available to the very, very few, now they've been able to go mass market and turn that into a product where the lower average income in India or China or the developing world can actually have access to transportation. \\n\\n###### ZenReach is a thriving company built by Atomic. How did the journey from idea to successful company unfold? \\n\\nZenreach is a phenomenal company and it’s a really great case study for Atomic. When we started that company it went through a lot of different forms. It started out as a company based on wifi and shared communications, then we started to see the value of offline experiences and converting offline customers. We eventually got to what Zenreach is today, which is a network aimed at small businesses for understanding their customer base and educating them on the companies offerings and doing it in a way which is incredibly simple for businesses to see a return on investment. \\n\\nThe way Atomic works is we build engines and once you find that engine where you know the inputs, outputs, and economics work, that’s when we can really accelerate unbelievably fast. So in the last year ZenReach has raised a tremendous amount of capital from some of the best investors in the world, added Peter Thiel to their board, who's one of the all time best investors, and are accelerating very quickly. I couldn't give more praise to the team that is able to push through and keep chugging along.\\n\\n###### What has been your breakout moment?\\n\\nJack Abraham, the founder and CEO of Atomic, likes to talk about this a lot: not all hours are made equally. At Atomic we physically look at our calendars at the end of the week and we quantify how much of each of the blocks really drove the business and made step function increases. We ask what we could not have been a part of and what would've still been fine. And it’s really just a question of leverage of time. Dropping out of Wharton and joining TokBox, there was no true logical explanation that I could have outlined. It was an instinct, it was an instinct on people, it was an instinct on being surrounded by mentors that could teach me, and it was an instinct of wanting to be in an environment that I would be forced to grow. When put in a situation where you need to grow, I believe most people will. Taking those kinds of bets have been incredibly valuable to me and they've been the cornerstone of my career. And there have only been a few of them, but grabbing them has been incredibly important. \\n\\n>==So I would encourage people to step back a little bit and find environments where they are able to take a bet on themselves and be in a room with brilliant people and brilliant mentors and struggle with the reality that they will have to do something spectacular. And if they can put themselves in those situations more often than not I think it’s a really phenomenal career move.==\\n\\n--------\\n\\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

Pain is unavoidable for those building something truly meaningful.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAndrew took a business leave from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School\nof Business after his sophomore year to join TokBox, a video communications\nstartup backed by Sequoia capital, as a product manager. He graduated from\nWharton in 2011. TokBox was acquired by Telefonica and Andrew moved on to start\nAtomic, a venture studio building entirely new companies from scratch.\n\nEditor: Atomic is a venture studio with strong roots at Wharton. Andrew is one\nof its visionary cofounders. On our visit to Atomic we noticed the contrarian\nnature of the studio, a hub of entrepreneurial talent that favors market and\ndistribution risk over technical risk. Atomic and Andrew have strong convictions\nin their ability to build impactful companies, their confidence is rooted in\ndecades of experience in the early stage company ecosystem. As we left we felt\nthe clear potential of their approach.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is important for us to know about you?\nI was born into a family that was all entrepreneurs. My grandfather and\ngrandparents on both sides were immigrants who came out from the West Bank and\nSyria in the mid 1900s. It all started with the traditional American immigrant\nstory. They were washing dishes and bussing tables and got kind of the bare\neducation. They built a business independently and were contrarian in their\nthinking throughout the life of their career. The mentality in my family is that\nwe don't necessarily care what you do, but what you do you have to be the best\nat it.\n\nAnd so growing up that was something that was really important to me and my\nextended family. So when I got to Wharton, I had been an entrepreneur in very\nsmall terms, I had corralled groups of friends to start projects in high school.\nWhile I was at Wharton I was spending most of my time building a nonprofit\ncompany for the Middle East that I was really excited about, a micro lending\ncompany. And what I noticed was that I was most energized and most passionate\nwhen I was actually doing things, learning in tough situations, and putting\nmyself in uncomfortable environments.\n\nAnd so my story is a bit less traditional. I ended up dropping after Wharton\nafter sophomore year, I joined a small startup out in San Francisco which had\nbeen backed by Sequoia Capital, it was about six people. I ran product for that\ncompany for four years. For me, putting myself in really tough situations is\nkind of the key to making an impact and feeling energized, so I ended up leaving\nWharton to pursue that. We ended up building that company into a video\ntechnology company called TokBox that we later sold to Telefonica which is one\nof the largest telecom companies in the world. After that I moved to London and\nI ran a 6,000 person innovation team for Telefonica. Then that desire to be put\nin really hard situations and build things from scratch came back so I moved out\nwest and started up Atomic, a venture studio, with some close friends and peers\nfrom Wharton that I had known for a long time. We pursued a model which we\nbelieved was a much more effective way of allocating capital and building\ncompanies.\n\nSo at a high level I think I had been an entrepreneur for a long time. What I\nalways loved doing was putting on shoes which were much bigger than me and\nseeing if I could fill them.\n\nWhat other paths could you have gone down?\nNot surprisingly I was looking at investment banking and consulting. It’s really\nquite difficult to do something like moving to San Francisco when all of my\nclosest friends, peers, and all of the people that I respected were from Wharton\nand moving to New York. They were working in banking and private equity, and\ntheir careers, starting from Wharton, had a fairly linear and expected behavior.\n\nYou'd join as an associate, you'd become a vice president, then partner. Then\nyou're 30 years old making this much money and have so-and-so title, it is\nreally quite difficult to say \"no” to something so laid out and linear.\n\nBut for me I have instinctively been someone who either needs to be the best at\nwhat they're doing or do something incredibly interesting. So sophomore year\nwhen I was evaluating options at JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc. I knew I didn't\nhave the financial brain to put me in the one percent, I knew I was good but I\nwasn't the best, and the idea of going down a path that was so laid out for me\nwas really quite constraining. I felt like it kind of sucked all the wind from\nmy sails. It was quite deflating in nature. But then the idea of taking a bet on\nmyself, moving to San Francisco, being in an environment where my success was\ndriven directly by my day-to-day actions and depended on how I did as opposed to\na much more linear path that was constrained by a structured environment — to\nme, that was unbelievably exciting.\n\nIt was an opportunity to take a bet on myself, the opportunity to get ahead in\nmany ways, and the opportunity to do something very, very different. And I'm\nvery thankful and blessed that I did that and had great advisors that were able\nto help me. At that time in the early 2000s, it was not something that people\ndid coming out of Wharton and my hope is that over time this becomes a much more\ncomfortable route for a lot of the smartest brains that we have in that school.\n\nHow did you go about designing your college experience and curriculum based on\nyour specific goals?\nI took a bit of a non-traditional path. Structured within the management\nconcentration at Wharton I studied venture capital. I was really proactive on\nday one by surrounding myself with professors that were teaching very relevant\ncourses, trying to get myself into engineering classes around product design and\nengineering entrepreneurship, and many types of things that weren't really laid\nout in a traditional concentration back then. The opportunities at Wharton are\nreally quite outstanding, the abilities to dive deep vertically into one\nspecific subject is powerful, and so I put a lot of time into trying to craft\nthe few years there into making them as practically helpful as possible for when\nI graduated and came back to San Francisco to try and build something.\n\nWhat was it about TokBox that you really loved: the technology, team, product,\nor something else?\nAt a really high level something I really believe is that you can get excited as\nan entrepreneur or an operator about a lot of different ideas. Some of the best\noperators and executives I've ever met mostly like solving hard problems and\nbeing surrounded by phenomenally brilliant people more so than they have a\nstrong passion towards an individual industry. So for TokBox it wasn't the video\nin particular that attracted me. I think video technology at the time was really\ncoming up from a market standpoint and growing rapidly, you had things like\nChatRoulette, Microsoft acquiring Skype, Salesforce building out chat\nexperiences, and today you have things like Twitch.tv [http://Twitch.tv],\nMeerket, Periscope and all of these. At the grand level I believed in the\nmarket, I believed the technology was valuable and the usage would be growing\nconsistently. What really got me excited though were the people, they were all\nex-operators, they were backed by Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Ron\nConway at SV Angel, and the board of directors was absolutely brilliant.\n\n==I was surrounded by people who I knew were smarter than me, people who I'd\nbeen researching. I'd learned from them via their blogs and things of that sort\nfor so long already. That's really what got me — the opportunity to learn and be\ntaught and mentored. ==\n\nGoing back to the idea of grit, what were the inflection points at TokBox,\nspecifically the lows of the lows, the most painful moments that you had?\nThere's probably a couple dozen of them that I could think of. TokBox was in\nevery way the stereotypical Silicon Valley story. Our founders left the company\nthe week before I started, they were having conflicts with the venture community\nand eventually left. We went through the process of hiring a new CEO and\nexecutive team, and a couple years later we pivoted, which is another Silicon\nValley thing to do. I had the opportunity to launch dozens of products that\nfailed — I learned all types of things about momentum and people management and\nexpectation management and board management.\n\nWe went through a number of rounds of financing — one of which was during 2008,\nwhich was a really brutal time to raise capital in the valley. And then we were\nable to experience a lot of acquisition options that didn't go through and\nfailed, which were close but didn't happen, and then finally, thankfully we were\nable to land a really phenomenal home for the company and a great exit. If you\nwatch Silicon Valley [http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley]  you go through all of\nthose stages of building a company and kind of in a silly way I was able to\nexperience all of those, which was pretty exciting.\n\nHow did you manage your psychology during the rough times you faced in the\nstartup world?\nI mean at the time you want to avoid all the pain but in retrospect what’s clear\nis that it’s impossible to avoid any of the pain.\n\nBut there are things you can learn and do better time after time which is one of\nthe beautiful aspects of the Atomic model. But the struggles that companies have\nwill always exist. The saying \"what doesn't kill you makes your stronger\" is 100\npercent accurate in the startup world. So when people come to me and say, \"I\nwant to be a founder or join a small startup, what do you think?\", I always\ncaution them: unless they are really bought into building something, I recommend\nthey should do something else. Those hardships, they'll always be there, it’s\noften what filters out the best from those who are just good, which is a pretty\nbig distinction. And it’s almost always necessary to build something meaningful.\n\nWhen you decided to leave Wharton were you dropping out or was it just another\nstep in exploring options?\nWharton was really phenomenal in giving me a lot of time to evaluate working in\nSilicon Valley. They give you the capacity to take a business leave, so I was\nable to work in San Francisco and then eventually a couple years later was able\nto graduate, which was phenomenal, while still having that opportunity to\nexplore some more immediate passions.\n\nWhy does Atomic value distribution so much?\nTwenty years ago when you went to raise venture capital you were physically\nbuilding something new, like semiconductors or some kind of new technology like\ncloud that had never been created before and the cost of doing so was\nexorbitant. The cost of setting up cloud infrastructure ten years ago was\nprobably 100 times as much as it is today. So over time what we saw is that\nbuilding companies became more of market risk versus technology risk.\n\nHistorically it was technology risk. Now really the questions are if something\nwill be adopted, will people love it, will they use it, will they share it with\nfriends, how will they access it, will it be valuable for their business. It’s\nnot a question of if we can actually build it. Some companies obviously are\ndifferent: AI or self driving cars, some of these are true technology risks, but\nfor the majority of companies and the majority of market cap you see coming out\nof Silicon Valley these days it’s really market risk — that is really what we\nspend time on at Atomic.\n\nWe ask how you de-risk something, how you evaluate go-to market models, how you\ntest them as much as possible early to really understand exactly what the\npotential is of the business and how can you use those methods to reinforce and\nre-educate the product decisions being made early on to get to product market\nfit early even faster. It is something that is only now possible due to the\ndecreased cost of open source technology and platforms like Twilio and AWS and\nHeroku and all of these things.\n\nHow do you do effective diligence on your company ideas?\nOne of the exciting aspects of Atomic is that we do not play in only one market.\nWe don't focus exclusively on healthcare or exclusively on enterprise software\nbusinesses. We like to play in a lot of different markets. So of the eight\ncompanies that we started in the last couple of years, a couple are consumer\ninternet, a couple are small business direct sales driven, a couple are\nenterprise, a couple are in healthcare. One of the energizing aspects of the\nmodel is that we're able to use many of the patterns that we recognize and apply\nthem into different verticals.\n\nWe go through a process of validating ideas. We have a book of about 400 to 500\nideas that could be really great companies. The way we do that is a few fold:\none is things that we're excited ourselves to see in the world, that we believe\nthat a company could fix or improve or meaningfully change the behavior of\nbillions of people. Another question is, is this something that could generate a\nbillion dollars in revenue? Could a billion people use this and would it improve\ntheir lives? One more thing we think about is what are products, experiences,\nand opportunities that exclusively wealthy and those with opportunity have had\nand how can we make those mass market, how can we give to the masses what has\nonce been only available to those in the one percent?\n\nThat’s something when you think of a company like Uber was really a driving\nforce — being able in one click to have a limo arrive was something that was\nonce just available to the very, very few, now they've been able to go mass\nmarket and turn that into a product where the lower average income in India or\nChina or the developing world can actually have access to transportation.\n\nZenReach is a thriving company built by Atomic. How did the journey from idea to\nsuccessful company unfold?\nZenreach is a phenomenal company and it’s a really great case study for Atomic.\nWhen we started that company it went through a lot of different forms. It\nstarted out as a company based on wifi and shared communications, then we\nstarted to see the value of offline experiences and converting offline\ncustomers. We eventually got to what Zenreach is today, which is a network aimed\nat small businesses for understanding their customer base and educating them on\nthe companies offerings and doing it in a way which is incredibly simple for\nbusinesses to see a return on investment.\n\nThe way Atomic works is we build engines and once you find that engine where you\nknow the inputs, outputs, and economics work, that’s when we can really\naccelerate unbelievably fast. So in the last year ZenReach has raised a\ntremendous amount of capital from some of the best investors in the world, added\nPeter Thiel to their board, who's one of the all time best investors, and are\naccelerating very quickly. I couldn't give more praise to the team that is able\nto push through and keep chugging along.\n\nWhat has been your breakout moment?\nJack Abraham, the founder and CEO of Atomic, likes to talk about this a lot: not\nall hours are made equally. At Atomic we physically look at our calendars at the\nend of the week and we quantify how much of each of the blocks really drove the\nbusiness and made step function increases. We ask what we could not have been a\npart of and what would've still been fine. And it’s really just a question of\nleverage of time. Dropping out of Wharton and joining TokBox, there was no true\nlogical explanation that I could have outlined. It was an instinct, it was an\ninstinct on people, it was an instinct on being surrounded by mentors that could\nteach me, and it was an instinct of wanting to be in an environment that I would\nbe forced to grow. When put in a situation where you need to grow, I believe\nmost people will. Taking those kinds of bets have been incredibly valuable to me\nand they've been the cornerstone of my career. And there have only been a few of\nthem, but grabbing them has been incredibly important.\n\nSo I would encourage people to step back a little bit and find environments\nwhere they are able to take a bet on themselves and be in a room with brilliant\npeople and brilliant mentors and struggle with the reality that they will have\nto do something spectacular. And if they can put themselves in those situations\nmore often than not I think it’s a really phenomenal career move.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania’s Huntsman Program in 2015 before spending time at Apollo Global Management as a private equity investor. \\n\\n*Editor: Abhi cares about two things: building something amazing and working out. I’ve had the pleasure of spending many hours with Abhi, he leads by example by displaying a tickling curiosity and steely resolve present in only the absolute best of leaders of our time. [Edward Lando](http://thesign.al/edward-lando-angel-investor-cofounder-at-horizons/), Abhi's classmate and cofounder, describes the Ramesh ethos perfectly: “He'll keep sawing away at any problem until it gives way.”*\\n\\n------\\n###### What's important about you?\\nImportant huh, very little I think. My name is Abhi Ramesh I am currently one of the founders of the Horizons School of technology. We essentially run a technology school that bridges the gap between a traditional college education and the real world of technology. So I actually graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton School, I was in the Huntsman program, which is dual degree there. I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, the good old South, but I was born in India, I lived in Dubai and Bahrain in the Middle East for a little bit and I lived in St. Louis and in Canada briefly, and now I am out in San Francisco doing  Horizons.\\n\\n###### Did you always want to be an entrepreneur when you grew up?\\nI did not. For the first half of my life, I wanted to be a neuroscientist. I remember at one point of my life I also wanted to be an astronaut. Most people want to be an astronaut when they are five or six but I decided I would be one when I was 16. Then after I came to Penn and Wharton, I decided I was really interested in finance and enjoyed the business side of things, and pursued a career in finance. Entrepreneurship for me was more of an accident to be honest.\\n\\n###### How did that accident come about?\\nI did have an interest [in entrepreneurship] before. In high school I was very involved in a bunch of different things. As a lot of Penn and Wharton students are, I was class president and eventually school president, two-sport varsity athlete, violinist for fourteen years, and I did all the traditional \\\"I'm a well rounded kid applying to college” type things. But I also enjoyed looking at different ideas and I did some SAT tutoring on the side when I was in high school and that connected to one of my first entrepreneurial experiences. So I was always interested in \\\"business\\\" broadly, whatever that means, but I decided to come to Penn and Wharton because it provided a very good, well rounded, business education. \\n\\n>==I didn't know what I wanted to do in the world of business I just knew I was interested in it.==\\n\\n###### What was your first impression of Wharton and Huntsman?\\nMy impression of Wharton was that it was very competitive. People come here to be the best in the world of business and finance. There are obviously cons to the competitiveness of Wharton, but overall, for me, I thrive in those types of environments, so I enjoyed that aspect of Wharton a lot. Huntsman for me provided a balanced sort of side to my college experience. Being enrolled in the liberal arts side of things, we have to study abroad, and we have a more traditional experience. Having not been born in the US and growing up in a lot of different countries I sort of enjoyed that international studies aspect of Huntsman. When I first came my first impression of Wharton and Huntsman was, \\\"Wow, a lot of very very talented kids who all want to go into business and finance and do cool things.\\\" For me it was very positive actually, I know some people took away some very negative things from their first impression, but for me it was overall positive.\\n\\n###### And what was your last impression? \\nStill overall positively skewed, but it left me kind of wishing for more. That was because some of the things I did in college were completely unrelated to college. I took a year off from school, I moved to Los Angeles, I raised a bunch of money from angel investors and venture capitalists, started multiple projects which then became multiple companies when I was in school. None of that was related to my traditional Penn experience. When I was leaving Penn and Wharton I thought I had a great foundation and it has taught a lot, but I just wished there was something that bridged the gap between where a lot of students want to be and what my experience was in school.\\n\\n###### And that eventually led to building the Horizons School?\\nIt did. And I think Horizons is only part of the equation, for students who want to be in technology, that leads to Horizons. I think there are other aspects of my Penn/Wharton experience that could've improved for folks who want to go into finance or who want to go into consulting. To be honest, despite the amazing finance curriculum that Wharton has a lot of the things that I learned relevant to finance, I learned on the side.\\n\\n###### What was your average day like in college?\\nCrazy. I played varsity sprint football my first two years. I tried rowing crew for a little bit too. I was a varsity athlete in high school so I really wanted that sort of experience in college as well. But when you're taking 7 classes, trying to juggle starting a company, and you have three hours of football practice every day 7 days a week, it becomes pretty difficult. So for me organization is a big thing, I had always been relatively organized but I forced myself to be insanely organized when I went to college. I still have all my agendas. I've written agendas for the past six years, in written format, and I have them still. So I used to be extremely organized — I woke up at 6:15 am, I'd to the gym if I didn't have workouts that day, I'd go do a relatively full day of classes, I'd go to football practice from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm, come back do homework for about three or four hours, go to bed and repeat. \\n\\n###### And where did the company start?\\nThe first company I worked on in college was Altair Prep. We were essentially building a pattern recognition based platform and tutoring methodology for the SAT and the ACT and eventually the goal was to expand into the GMAT. A lot of these test prep curricula are very much one size fits all in their approach and we wanted to be a hyper personalized platform and tutoring methodology. So this again was completely on accident. It was over Thanksgiving break or winter break, one of my good high school friends, Darwish Gani, and I were sitting in my basement talking about the SAT. We had tutored both our younger brothers, we had both scored pretty well on the SAT, and we just talked about the options out there. And there was no premium test prep offering that was hyper personalized. We just talked about it and nothing came about it for a couple months after our conversation then all of a sudden we said, \\\"Hey, this thing should exist\\\", so I started dedicating three hours of what would've been my sleep time to getting Altair Prep off the ground. \\n\\n###### When did you learn to code and why?\\nAltair Prep led me to take a year off from school. It was a really tough decision. Today taking time off from school is a little bit less serious. When I was in school it was very taboo, especially at Wharton where there is a traditional very structured path to success. My sophomore summer I had signed an offer to work at a private equity firm. In the third week of May, I called up the guy who gave me the offer at the private equity firm and I said, \\\"I cannot take this offer I have to pursue this venture that is taking off.\\\" His reaction was probably not the most appropriate of reactions, he was extremely upset that I had told him this late and promised I would not have a career in finance and kind of turned me off for a while from finance. \\n\\nBut I ended up pursuing Altair Prep that summer and it ended up going very well, so my cofounders and I took a semester off from school that eventually became two semesters. We realized though that Altair Prep was an interesting product and although we tried to build a piece of software out of it we couldn't, partially because software wasn't what was needed to solve that problem and partially because we didn't know how to code. \\n\\nWe spent a bunch of money hiring a CTO and a series of freelancers and that didn't work out because there were always things we needed to fix and add and it was an ongoing process. Eventually I got extremely frustrated and we decided to pause Altair Prep and I decided I was going to learn how to code. So I moved from Philadelphia, where Altair was based, to Los Angeles because there were a handful of angel investors who agreed to basically fund what was initially an idea at the time, but more so to fund my learning experience to learn how to code. So I moved to LA with one of the Altair Prep cofounders Vinny and spent that year just coding. We went to 25 different hackathons. I spent 14 to 16 hours a day in front of a computer learning to code. I started off with Ruby on Rails and learning to code came less from interest or desire and more so just need.\\n\\n###### How did you get the ideas and the problems to solve?\\n>==A lot of it had to do with being outside of my daily environment. When you're within the Penn bubble that people so affectionately like to talk about, you're exposed to the same problems every single day. You talk to the same types of people, you have the same routine everyday. When you pack up your bags and move to a different city, LA for me, and you're no longer in school, the people you interact with are 35 or 40 years old, the set of problems you see are very different.==\\n\\n I kept a running list of random ideas I came up with and decided to tackle those one at a time once I learned how to code. Looking back I don't think that was the greatest choice. I think it would've been better to say I'm going to tackle one and build it out completely but instead we built something for 3 or 4 months and kept switching. So I was able to build a lot of things. A couple of them went from idea to business but I never actually started to consider a company.\\n\\n###### Did any of your hacks get you into trouble?\\n\\nYes, one of them got me into quite a bit of trouble. Preregistration time at Penn I decided I was going to build something very useful. I stumbled into a vulnerability with the way the scheduling platform was built. We discovered you could plug in a class at Penn and display a list of registered students at Penn including their photos, names, email addresses, everything. So I decided to exploit the vulnerability and build a platform for students to input any class name and discover who was taking the class. We had over 3000 people on it in the first 24 hours. Then I got contacted by the Penn administration and the head of IT who sent me a cease and desist letter and cut off my access to all my Penn accounts. It was a huge privacy violation and it got pretty messy, but it was over quick.\\n\\n###### Did you work on all of this stuff alone?\\nI did a lot of this alone but we had a good community. Edward Lando, Vinny Pujji, an older friend of mine, Jose, but most of the time I was spending my own time doing it. At the time, the people who were interested in technology was a small community and closely knit. The relationships were pretty organic though, no formally organized things.\\n\\n###### You did a lot of your learning outside college walls, so what do you think the current role of four year colleges are?\\n\\nThe four year structure is probably going to change. The time frame over which you are in college is going to change. College does two things well: providing an ecosystem for you to explore and preparing you for the real world in some ways. Most universities tend to do one or the other and very few colleges do both. You have the Whartons of the world, which get you extremely well prepared for the real world if you're tackling finance or consulting but when it comes to exploration you're pretty limited. And then you have schools that are much more so on the exploration side but when it comes to preparation for the real world, they're lacking. \\n\\n>==I think a real college experience will allow you to do both and that’s sort of where things are headed. Part of the problem is the four year structure, because for some people the exploration is a very short period of time, like 6 months, and then they need to be prepared for the real world and move from exploration to exploitation — building products and getting ready for the real world. For other people it takes three years, four years, five years, six years. They want to take more classes, get graduate degrees and things like that. In the coming years the four year structure will become much more individualized.==\\n\\n######Where does your entrepreneurial journey and Horizons play in that world?\\nWhat we do is exactly that for technology. We provide a platform for students who are ambitious and interested in technology to explore the sector and at the same time prepare them for the real world. You come through our program to learn how to code and build different things but also to explore technology in general. You might be interested in AI or Natural Language Processing or you might be interested in mobile social apps but you explore all these things and figure out what you're interested in. \\n\\n######After college did you join another company or build your own startup?\\nNeither. I did the opposite. I went and worked at a very large financial institution, at a private equity firm called Apollo. There are a lot of people for whom its one of the other, they find technology in college, or something else in college and they love it. And they're able to sort of put everything else away and focus on that completely. \\n\\nFor me, I learned how to code built a lot of things and was super interested in technology but I also happened to be really interested in finance. Part of me almost regretted not being able to explore the financial world more, having gone to a premier university that prides itself on being the best to train people in finance and business. I felt like I hadn't exploited that as effectively as I could have. I did a finance internship in my college career in banking at Moelis and Company, so I leveraged that after I graduated and told myself to spend a little bit of time in finance. \\n\\nI wanted to learn investing from a professional point of view but I promised myself I would only spent time there if I was really learning. So I went to Apollo working on their middle market technology investing platform and got to see how technology companies were run. I got a great understanding of later stage technology, and after eight months I realized I wasn't learning anymore. \\n\\n###### Did you automatically start working on Horizons?\\nHorizons started at the tail end of my Apollo career. I have a lot to thank to Penn, Wharton, and finance in general because being in that world I saw a large number of very talented, young graduates who spent a year in banking or consulting and then they wanted to move into tech. \\n\\nPartly due to the fact that tech as we know it is more broadly defined and partly due to the fact that the opportunity set has increased now where you can have a very viable career as an engineer or product manager or starting your own company. So I saw a lot of our Wharton peers trying to go into tech but they couldn't. They didn't know how to code or they just didn't fundamentally understand the market, they didn't have a product thinking skill set, so a lot of them felt stuck and that the doors were closed off. I had spoken to Darwish, my cofounder from the Altair Prep days about this. He had actually taken a coding bootcamp program and was working as a product manager and he told me about how much he had learned in a short period of time and how he shifted his career trajectory by learning to code. \\n\\nSo the idea came together pretty quickly for us because I was someone who experienced this problem, Darwish was somebody who experienced this problem and we saw a lot of folks around us who were experiencing this problem every day. So we kind of came up with a wireframe for Horizons and started building it out for a couple week and I very quickly left Apollo after.\\n\\n###### How do you know when to quit something like finance and go for something else you love like technology?\\n>==You'll quit before you know, or you'll have to, that's the rule.== \\n\\nI spend a lot of time thinking about this. I sort of pegged quitting my job to a lot of different metrics like \\\"we need this many students\\\" or \\\"we should have hired this many people\\\" or \\\"it should be 73 degrees in New York\\\" — I had a bunch of random metrics I pegged this to and at some point I realized it was a chicken and egg problem. We couldn't reach those metrics that we set until the commitment was there. It varies from career to career. I worked at a very rigorous financial institution, I was up at 7:00 am, in the office by 8:15 am, and I left at 10:30 or 11:00 pm on a good day. For me to commit time outside of work on a venture would mean midnight to 2:00 or 3:00 am. Eventually I gave myself a deadline. I said, \\\"On this day I'm going to quit\\\", put it in my calendar, and on that day I quit. \\n\\n###### So what is the work-life balance like now?\\nThe myth of entrepreneurship is that you set your own hours so there is work-life balance that you can control. The truth, which very few people will tell you, is that your work life balance will get worse. But I think that’s due to the fact that work and life become the same thing for you. When you work a traditional corporate job there is a clear distinction between work and life so people can talk about the concept of work-life balance. When you start a company your life is that company. At Horizons at least, we're happy about it. \\n\\n###### Does it help that you're working with some of your best friends?\\n\\nOh yeah that helps a lot. If you work with people that you hate, you'll hate your job and you career. I love working with my friends, and with like minded people. Darwish and [Lando](http://thesign.al/edward-lando-angel-investor-cofounder-at-horizons/) are two of the only people who on a Saturday or Sunday night regularly will talk about ideas in the office and how we can grow the company, and how we can make the product better, and how to help more students. You have to find more people who have the same mindset and liking them makes it much easier. \\n\\n###### What is your advice for students in college?\\nKeep in mind I'm not too far out from school. The best piece of advice I can give is not to wait. There is an archetype in our minds of a successful person. It’s generally someone who is 33 or 34 years old who has spent time in an industry, who realizes there are all these problems, decides to go tackle one, and goes to build a company. Or it’s someone who climbs up the corporate ladder for 15 to 20 years, becomes hyper successful, and goes and buys a house in the Hamptons. \\n\\n> ==The biggest flaw with this is the notion you must wait to be successful, and wait to go out and try something. In school you have a sandbox you are playing in that is completely risk free. College is the most risk free four years of your life. You can fail miserably and you'll be okay. You will never have that time ever again. After college the clock starts ticking for real.==\\n\\n###### With that in mind would you have done something different in your college experience?\\n\\nI took a year off from school but a lot of the things I was working on in my year off felt ephemeral because I knew I had to come back to school. There is an incredible amount of value to being at universities and in college but when you have the mindset of having to operate within the confines of a four year university college education, you lose creativity. I stopped working on a very successful company or idea because I felt I was limited to a year and had to go back to school. \\n\\nIf I was back in college I would've stayed out for a little bit longer. And I'm not saying I would have dropped out of college but I just mean if things were going well I wouldn't have decided to come back just to come back. I would have pursued whatever project I was working on and seen them through before coming back to school.\\n\\n###### How do you filter out the noise when everyone around you is doing the same thing?\\n\\nIt's extremely difficult. Especially at a schools like Penn and Wharton there is an incredible amount of pressure to take part in the prevailing ecosystem, which is the banking and consulting ecosystem. Nobody can do it by themselves. \\n\\n>==If you're the only guy or girl working on something and every other person around you is working on something else, it takes an incredible amount of mental strength to keep doing that. You have to have a community. You have to have other people around you that support what you're doing and who feel the same way. Finding those people come from putting yourself in the right environment. ==\\n\\n###### Any last words?\\nWe've covered a lot. One thing I'd like to reiterate is this is your time to experiment. You have little free time in your life to do so. It doesn't have to be starting a company. Just do as much as you can to explore while you're still here at school. \\n\\n------\\n\\n###### Editor’s Key Takeaways\\n1. College does not have to be a four year straight line experience. Explore until you have the skills and perspective you need to do the work you want to, this can take six months or six years. \\n2. An incredible amount of mental strength is necessary to filter out the noise surrounding each and every one of us. We require community to persevere. \\n3. College is a risk free sandbox. Whoever said you must wait to be successful and do your life's work was wrong. \\n\\n*Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

My name is Abhi Ramesh I am currently one of the founders of the Horizons School of technology. We essentially run a technology school that bridges the gap between a traditional college education and the real world of technology. So I actually graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton School, I was in the Huntsman program, which is dual degree there. I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, the good old South, but I was born in India, I lived in Dubai and Bahrain in the Middle East for a little bit and I lived in St. Louis and in Canada briefly, and now I am out in San Francisco doing  Horizons.</p>\n<h6 id=\"didyoualwayswanttobeanentrepreneurwhenyougrewup\">Did you always want to be an entrepreneur when you grew up?</h6>\n<p>I did not. For the first half of my life, I wanted to be a neuroscientist. I remember at one point of my life I also wanted to be an astronaut. Most people want to be an astronaut when they are five or six but I decided I would be one when I was 16. Then after I came to Penn and Wharton, I decided I was really interested in finance and enjoyed the business side of things, and pursued a career in finance. Entrepreneurship for me was more of an accident to be honest.</p>\n<h6 id=\"howdidthataccidentcomeabout\">How did that accident come about?</h6>\n<p>I did have an interest [in entrepreneurship] before. In high school I was very involved in a bunch of different things. As a lot of Penn and Wharton students are, I was class president and eventually school president, two-sport varsity athlete, violinist for fourteen years, and I did all the traditional &quot;I'm a well rounded kid applying to college” type things. But I also enjoyed looking at different ideas and I did some SAT tutoring on the side when I was in high school and that connected to one of my first entrepreneurial experiences. So I was always interested in &quot;business&quot; broadly, whatever that means, but I decided to come to Penn and Wharton because it provided a very good, well rounded, business education.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>I didn't know what I wanted to do in the world of business I just knew I was interested in it.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h6 id=\"whatwasyourfirstimpressionofwhartonandhuntsman\">What was your first impression of Wharton and Huntsman?</h6>\n<p>My impression of Wharton was that it was very competitive. People come here to be the best in the world of business and finance. There are obviously cons to the competitiveness of Wharton, but overall, for me, I thrive in those types of environments, so I enjoyed that aspect of Wharton a lot. Huntsman for me provided a balanced sort of side to my college experience. Being enrolled in the liberal arts side of things, we have to study abroad, and we have a more traditional experience. Having not been born in the US and growing up in a lot of different countries I sort of enjoyed that international studies aspect of Huntsman. When I first came my first impression of Wharton and Huntsman was, &quot;Wow, a lot of very very talented kids who all want to go into business and finance and do cool things.&quot; For me it was very positive actually, I know some people took away some very negative things from their first impression, but for me it was overall positive.</p>\n<h6 id=\"andwhatwasyourlastimpression\">And what was your last impression?</h6>\n<p>Still overall positively skewed, but it left me kind of wishing for more. That was because some of the things I did in college were completely unrelated to college. I took a year off from school, I moved to Los Angeles, I raised a bunch of money from angel investors and venture capitalists, started multiple projects which then became multiple companies when I was in school. None of that was related to my traditional Penn experience. When I was leaving Penn and Wharton I thought I had a great foundation and it has taught a lot, but I just wished there was something that bridged the gap between where a lot of students want to be and what my experience was in school.</p>\n<h6 id=\"andthateventuallyledtobuildingthehorizonsschool\">And that eventually led to building the Horizons School?</h6>\n<p>It did. And I think Horizons is only part of the equation, for students who want to be in technology, that leads to Horizons. I think there are other aspects of my Penn/Wharton experience that could've improved for folks who want to go into finance or who want to go into consulting. To be honest, despite the amazing finance curriculum that Wharton has a lot of the things that I learned relevant to finance, I learned on the side.</p>\n<h6 id=\"whatwasyouraveragedaylikeincollege\">What was your average day like in college?</h6>\n<p>Crazy. I played varsity sprint football my first two years. I tried rowing crew for a little bit too. I was a varsity athlete in high school so I really wanted that sort of experience in college as well. But when you're taking 7 classes, trying to juggle starting a company, and you have three hours of football practice every day 7 days a week, it becomes pretty difficult. So for me organization is a big thing, I had always been relatively organized but I forced myself to be insanely organized when I went to college. I still have all my agendas. I've written agendas for the past six years, in written format, and I have them still. So I used to be extremely organized — I woke up at 6:15 am, I'd to the gym if I didn't have workouts that day, I'd go do a relatively full day of classes, I'd go to football practice from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm, come back do homework for about three or four hours, go to bed and repeat.</p>\n<h6 id=\"andwheredidthecompanystart\">And where did the company start?</h6>\n<p>The first company I worked on in college was Altair Prep. We were essentially building a pattern recognition based platform and tutoring methodology for the SAT and the ACT and eventually the goal was to expand into the GMAT. A lot of these test prep curricula are very much one size fits all in their approach and we wanted to be a hyper personalized platform and tutoring methodology. So this again was completely on accident. It was over Thanksgiving break or winter break, one of my good high school friends, Darwish Gani, and I were sitting in my basement talking about the SAT. We had tutored both our younger brothers, we had both scored pretty well on the SAT, and we just talked about the options out there. And there was no premium test prep offering that was hyper personalized. We just talked about it and nothing came about it for a couple months after our conversation then all of a sudden we said, &quot;Hey, this thing should exist&quot;, so I started dedicating three hours of what would've been my sleep time to getting Altair Prep off the ground.</p>\n<h6 id=\"whendidyoulearntocodeandwhy\">When did you learn to code and why?</h6>\n<p>Altair Prep led me to take a year off from school. It was a really tough decision. Today taking time off from school is a little bit less serious. When I was in school it was very taboo, especially at Wharton where there is a traditional very structured path to success. My sophomore summer I had signed an offer to work at a private equity firm. In the third week of May, I called up the guy who gave me the offer at the private equity firm and I said, &quot;I cannot take this offer I have to pursue this venture that is taking off.&quot; His reaction was probably not the most appropriate of reactions, he was extremely upset that I had told him this late and promised I would not have a career in finance and kind of turned me off for a while from finance.</p>\n<p>But I ended up pursuing Altair Prep that summer and it ended up going very well, so my cofounders and I took a semester off from school that eventually became two semesters. We realized though that Altair Prep was an interesting product and although we tried to build a piece of software out of it we couldn't, partially because software wasn't what was needed to solve that problem and partially because we didn't know how to code.</p>\n<p>We spent a bunch of money hiring a CTO and a series of freelancers and that didn't work out because there were always things we needed to fix and add and it was an ongoing process. Eventually I got extremely frustrated and we decided to pause Altair Prep and I decided I was going to learn how to code. So I moved from Philadelphia, where Altair was based, to Los Angeles because there were a handful of angel investors who agreed to basically fund what was initially an idea at the time, but more so to fund my learning experience to learn how to code. So I moved to LA with one of the Altair Prep cofounders Vinny and spent that year just coding. We went to 25 different hackathons. I spent 14 to 16 hours a day in front of a computer learning to code. I started off with Ruby on Rails and learning to code came less from interest or desire and more so just need.</p>\n<h6 id=\"howdidyougettheideasandtheproblemstosolve\">How did you get the ideas and the problems to solve?</h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>A lot of it had to do with being outside of my daily environment. When you're within the Penn bubble that people so affectionately like to talk about, you're exposed to the same problems every single day. You talk to the same types of people, you have the same routine everyday. When you pack up your bags and move to a different city, LA for me, and you're no longer in school, the people you interact with are 35 or 40 years old, the set of problems you see are very different.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I kept a running list of random ideas I came up with and decided to tackle those one at a time once I learned how to code. Looking back I don't think that was the greatest choice. I think it would've been better to say I'm going to tackle one and build it out completely but instead we built something for 3 or 4 months and kept switching. So I was able to build a lot of things. A couple of them went from idea to business but I never actually started to consider a company.</p>\n<h6 id=\"didanyofyourhacksgetyouintotrouble\">Did any of your hacks get you into trouble?</h6>\n<p>Yes, one of them got me into quite a bit of trouble. Preregistration time at Penn I decided I was going to build something very useful. I stumbled into a vulnerability with the way the scheduling platform was built. We discovered you could plug in a class at Penn and display a list of registered students at Penn including their photos, names, email addresses, everything. So I decided to exploit the vulnerability and build a platform for students to input any class name and discover who was taking the class. We had over 3000 people on it in the first 24 hours. Then I got contacted by the Penn administration and the head of IT who sent me a cease and desist letter and cut off my access to all my Penn accounts. It was a huge privacy violation and it got pretty messy, but it was over quick.</p>\n<h6 id=\"didyouworkonallofthisstuffalone\">Did you work on all of this stuff alone?</h6>\n<p>I did a lot of this alone but we had a good community. Edward Lando, Vinny Pujji, an older friend of mine, Jose, but most of the time I was spending my own time doing it. At the time, the people who were interested in technology was a small community and closely knit. The relationships were pretty organic though, no formally organized things.</p>\n<h6 id=\"youdidalotofyourlearningoutsidecollegewallssowhatdoyouthinkthecurrentroleoffouryearcollegesare\">You did a lot of your learning outside college walls, so what do you think the current role of four year colleges are?</h6>\n<p>The four year structure is probably going to change. The time frame over which you are in college is going to change. College does two things well: providing an ecosystem for you to explore and preparing you for the real world in some ways. Most universities tend to do one or the other and very few colleges do both. You have the Whartons of the world, which get you extremely well prepared for the real world if you're tackling finance or consulting but when it comes to exploration you're pretty limited. And then you have schools that are much more so on the exploration side but when it comes to preparation for the real world, they're lacking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>I think a real college experience will allow you to do both and that’s sort of where things are headed. Part of the problem is the four year structure, because for some people the exploration is a very short period of time, like 6 months, and then they need to be prepared for the real world and move from exploration to exploitation — building products and getting ready for the real world. For other people it takes three years, four years, five years, six years. They want to take more classes, get graduate degrees and things like that. In the coming years the four year structure will become much more individualized.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h6 id=\"wheredoesyourentrepreneurialjourneyandhorizonsplayinthatworld\">Where does your entrepreneurial journey and Horizons play in that world?</h6>\n<p>What we do is exactly that for technology. We provide a platform for students who are ambitious and interested in technology to explore the sector and at the same time prepare them for the real world. You come through our program to learn how to code and build different things but also to explore technology in general. You might be interested in AI or Natural Language Processing or you might be interested in mobile social apps but you explore all these things and figure out what you're interested in.</p>\n<h6 id=\"aftercollegedidyoujoinanothercompanyorbuildyourownstartup\">After college did you join another company or build your own startup?</h6>\n<p>Neither. I did the opposite. I went and worked at a very large financial institution, at a private equity firm called Apollo. There are a lot of people for whom its one of the other, they find technology in college, or something else in college and they love it. And they're able to sort of put everything else away and focus on that completely.</p>\n<p>For me, I learned how to code built a lot of things and was super interested in technology but I also happened to be really interested in finance. Part of me almost regretted not being able to explore the financial world more, having gone to a premier university that prides itself on being the best to train people in finance and business. I felt like I hadn't exploited that as effectively as I could have.

So I actually graduated from the University of\nPennsylvania and the Wharton School, I was in the Huntsman program, which is\ndual degree there. I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, the good old South, but I was\nborn in India, I lived in Dubai and Bahrain in the Middle East for a little bit\nand I lived in St. Louis and in Canada briefly, and now I am out in San\nFrancisco doing Horizons.\n\nDid you always want to be an entrepreneur when you grew up?\nI did not. For the first half of my life, I wanted to be a neuroscientist. I\nremember at one point of my life I also wanted to be an astronaut. Most people\nwant to be an astronaut when they are five or six but I decided I would be one\nwhen I was 16. Then after I came to Penn and Wharton, I decided I was really\ninterested in finance and enjoyed the business side of things, and pursued a\ncareer in finance. Entrepreneurship for me was more of an accident to be honest.\n\nHow did that accident come about?\nI did have an interest [in entrepreneurship] before. In high school I was very\ninvolved in a bunch of different things. As a lot of Penn and Wharton students\nare, I was class president and eventually school president, two-sport varsity\nathlete, violinist for fourteen years, and I did all the traditional \"I'm a well\nrounded kid applying to college” type things. But I also enjoyed looking at\ndifferent ideas and I did some SAT tutoring on the side when I was in high\nschool and that connected to one of my first entrepreneurial experiences. So I\nwas always interested in \"business\" broadly, whatever that means, but I decided\nto come to Penn and Wharton because it provided a very good, well rounded,\nbusiness education.\n\nI didn't know what I wanted to do in the world of business I just knew I was\ninterested in it.\n\nWhat was your first impression of Wharton and Huntsman?\nMy impression of Wharton was that it was very competitive. People come here to\nbe the best in the world of business and finance. There are obviously cons to\nthe competitiveness of Wharton, but overall, for me, I thrive in those types of\nenvironments, so I enjoyed that aspect of Wharton a lot. Huntsman for me\nprovided a balanced sort of side to my college experience. Being enrolled in the\nliberal arts side of things, we have to study abroad, and we have a more\ntraditional experience. Having not been born in the US and growing up in a lot\nof different countries I sort of enjoyed that international studies aspect of\nHuntsman. When I first came my first impression of Wharton and Huntsman was,\n\"Wow, a lot of very very talented kids who all want to go into business and\nfinance and do cool things.\" For me it was very positive actually, I know some\npeople took away some very negative things from their first impression, but for\nme it was overall positive.\n\nAnd what was your last impression?\nStill overall positively skewed, but it left me kind of wishing for more. That\nwas because some of the things I did in college were completely unrelated to\ncollege. I took a year off from school, I moved to Los Angeles, I raised a bunch\nof money from angel investors and venture capitalists, started multiple projects\nwhich then became multiple companies when I was in school. None of that was\nrelated to my traditional Penn experience. When I was leaving Penn and Wharton I\nthought I had a great foundation and it has taught a lot, but I just wished\nthere was something that bridged the gap between where a lot of students want to\nbe and what my experience was in school.\n\nAnd that eventually led to building the Horizons School?\nIt did. And I think Horizons is only part of the equation, for students who want\nto be in technology, that leads to Horizons. I think there are other aspects of\nmy Penn/Wharton experience that could've improved for folks who want to go into\nfinance or who want to go into consulting. To be honest, despite the amazing\nfinance curriculum that Wharton has a lot of the things that I learned relevant\nto finance, I learned on the side.\n\nWhat was your average day like in college?\nCrazy. I played varsity sprint football my first two years. I tried rowing crew\nfor a little bit too. I was a varsity athlete in high school so I really wanted\nthat sort of experience in college as well. But when you're taking 7 classes,\ntrying to juggle starting a company, and you have three hours of football\npractice every day 7 days a week, it becomes pretty difficult. So for me\norganization is a big thing, I had always been relatively organized but I forced\nmyself to be insanely organized when I went to college. I still have all my\nagendas. I've written agendas for the past six years, in written format, and I\nhave them still. So I used to be extremely organized — I woke up at 6:15 am, I'd\nto the gym if I didn't have workouts that day, I'd go do a relatively full day\nof classes, I'd go to football practice from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm, come back do\nhomework for about three or four hours, go to bed and repeat.\n\nAnd where did the company start?\nThe first company I worked on in college was Altair Prep. We were essentially\nbuilding a pattern recognition based platform and tutoring methodology for the\nSAT and the ACT and eventually the goal was to expand into the GMAT. A lot of\nthese test prep curricula are very much one size fits all in their approach and\nwe wanted to be a hyper personalized platform and tutoring methodology. So this\nagain was completely on accident. It was over Thanksgiving break or winter\nbreak, one of my good high school friends, Darwish Gani, and I were sitting in\nmy basement talking about the SAT. We had tutored both our younger brothers, we\nhad both scored pretty well on the SAT, and we just talked about the options out\nthere. And there was no premium test prep offering that was hyper personalized.\nWe just talked about it and nothing came about it for a couple months after our\nconversation then all of a sudden we said, \"Hey, this thing should exist\", so I\nstarted dedicating three hours of what would've been my sleep time to getting\nAltair Prep off the ground.\n\nWhen did you learn to code and why?\nAltair Prep led me to take a year off from school. It was a really tough\ndecision. Today taking time off from school is a little bit less serious. When I\nwas in school it was very taboo, especially at Wharton where there is a\ntraditional very structured path to success. My sophomore summer I had signed an\noffer to work at a private equity firm. In the third week of May, I called up\nthe guy who gave me the offer at the private equity firm and I said, \"I cannot\ntake this offer I have to pursue this venture that is taking off.\" His reaction\nwas probably not the most appropriate of reactions, he was extremely upset that\nI had told him this late and promised I would not have a career in finance and\nkind of turned me off for a while from finance.\n\nBut I ended up pursuing Altair Prep that summer and it ended up going very well,\nso my cofounders and I took a semester off from school that eventually became\ntwo semesters. We realized though that Altair Prep was an interesting product\nand although we tried to build a piece of software out of it we couldn't,\npartially because software wasn't what was needed to solve that problem and\npartially because we didn't know how to code.\n\nWe spent a bunch of money hiring a CTO and a series of freelancers and that\ndidn't work out because there were always things we needed to fix and add and it\nwas an ongoing process. Eventually I got extremely frustrated and we decided to\npause Altair Prep and I decided I was going to learn how to code. So I moved\nfrom Philadelphia, where Altair was based, to Los Angeles because there were a\nhandful of angel investors who agreed to basically fund what was initially an\nidea at the time, but more so to fund my learning experience to learn how to\ncode. So I moved to LA with one of the Altair Prep cofounders Vinny and spent\nthat year just coding. We went to 25 different hackathons. I spent 14 to 16\nhours a day in front of a computer learning to code. I started off with Ruby on\nRails and learning to code came less from interest or desire and more so just\nneed.\n\nHow did you get the ideas and the problems to solve?\nA lot of it had to do with being outside of my daily environment. When you're\nwithin the Penn bubble that people so affectionately like to talk about, you're\nexposed to the same problems every single day. You talk to the same types of\npeople, you have the same routine everyday. When you pack up your bags and move\nto a different city, LA for me, and you're no longer in school, the people you\ninteract with are 35 or 40 years old, the set of problems you see are very\ndifferent.\n\nI kept a running list of random ideas I came up with and decided to tackle those\none at a time once I learned how to code. Looking back I don't think that was\nthe greatest choice. I think it would've been better to say I'm going to tackle\none and build it out completely but instead we built something for 3 or 4 months\nand kept switching. So I was able to build a lot of things. A couple of them\nwent from idea to business but I never actually started to consider a company.\n\nDid any of your hacks get you into trouble?\nYes, one of them got me into quite a bit of trouble. Preregistration time at\nPenn I decided I was going to build something very useful. I stumbled into a\nvulnerability with the way the scheduling platform was built. We discovered you\ncould plug in a class at Penn and display a list of registered students at Penn\nincluding their photos, names, email addresses, everything. So I decided to\nexploit the vulnerability and build a platform for students to input any class\nname and discover who was taking the class. We had over 3000 people on it in the\nfirst 24 hours. Then I got contacted by the Penn administration and the head of\nIT who sent me a cease and desist letter and cut off my access to all my Penn\naccounts. It was a huge privacy violation and it got pretty messy, but it was\nover quick.\n\nDid you work on all of this stuff alone?\nI did a lot of this alone but we had a good community. Edward Lando, Vinny\nPujji, an older friend of mine, Jose, but most of the time I was spending my own\ntime doing it. At the time, the people who were interested in technology was a\nsmall community and closely knit. The relationships were pretty organic though,\nno formally organized things.\n\nYou did a lot of your learning outside college walls, so what do you think the\ncurrent role of four year colleges are?\nThe four year structure is probably going to change. The time frame over which\nyou are in college is going to change. College does two things well: providing\nan ecosystem for you to explore and preparing you for the real world in some\nways. Most universities tend to do one or the other and very few colleges do\nboth. You have the Whartons of the world, which get you extremely well prepared\nfor the real world if you're tackling finance or consulting but when it comes to\nexploration you're pretty limited. And then you have schools that are much more\nso on the exploration side but when it comes to preparation for the real world,\nthey're lacking.\n\nI think a real college experience will allow you to do both and that’s sort of\nwhere things are headed. Part of the problem is the four year structure, because\nfor some people the exploration is a very short period of time, like 6 months,\nand then they need to be prepared for the real world and move from exploration\nto exploitation — building products and getting ready for the real world. For\nother people it takes three years, four years, five years, six years. They want\nto take more classes, get graduate degrees and things like that. In the coming\nyears the four year structure will become much more individualized.\n\nWhere does your entrepreneurial journey and Horizons play in that world?\nWhat we do is exactly that for technology. We provide a platform for students\nwho are ambitious and interested in technology to explore the sector and at the\nsame time prepare them for the real world. You come through our program to learn\nhow to code and build different things but also to explore technology in\ngeneral. You might be interested in AI or Natural Language Processing or you\nmight be interested in mobile social apps but you explore all these things and\nfigure out what you're interested in.\n\nAfter college did you join another company or build your own startup?\nNeither. I did the opposite. I went and worked at a very large financial\ninstitution, at a private equity firm called Apollo. There are a lot of people\nfor whom its one of the other, they find technology in college, or something\nelse in college and they love it. And they're able to sort of put everything\nelse away and focus on that completely.\n\nFor me, I learned how to code built a lot of things and was super interested in\ntechnology but I also happened to be really interested in finance. Part of me\nalmost regretted not being able to explore the financial world more, having gone\nto a premier university that prides itself on being the best to train people in\nfinance and business. I felt like I hadn't exploited that as effectively as I\ncould have. I did a finance internship in my college career in banking at Moelis\nand Company, so I leveraged that after I graduated and told myself to spend a\nlittle bit of time in finance.\n\nI wanted to learn investing from a professional point of view but I promised\nmyself I would only spent time there if I was really learning. So I went to\nApollo working on their middle market technology investing platform and got to\nsee how technology companies were run. I got a great understanding of later\nstage technology, and after eight months I realized I wasn't learning anymore.\n\nDid you automatically start working on Horizons?\nHorizons started at the tail end of my Apollo career. I have a lot to thank to\nPenn, Wharton, and finance in general because being in that world I saw a large\nnumber of very talented, young graduates who spent a year in banking or\nconsulting and then they wanted to move into tech.\n\nPartly due to the fact that tech as we know it is more broadly defined and\npartly due to the fact that the opportunity set has increased now where you can\nhave a very viable career as an engineer or product manager or starting your own\ncompany. So I saw a lot of our Wharton peers trying to go into tech but they\ncouldn't. They didn't know how to code or they just didn't fundamentally\nunderstand the market, they didn't have a product thinking skill set, so a lot\nof them felt stuck and that the doors were closed off. I had spoken to Darwish,\nmy cofounder from the Altair Prep days about this. He had actually taken a\ncoding bootcamp program and was working as a product manager and he told me\nabout how much he had learned in a short period of time and how he shifted his\ncareer trajectory by learning to code.\n\nSo the idea came together pretty quickly for us because I was someone who\nexperienced this problem, Darwish was somebody who experienced this problem and\nwe saw a lot of folks around us who were experiencing this problem every day. So\nwe kind of came up with a wireframe for Horizons and started building it out for\na couple week and I very quickly left Apollo after.\n\nHow do you know when to quit something like finance and go for something else\nyou love like technology?\nYou'll quit before you know, or you'll have to, that's the rule.\n\nI spend a lot of time thinking about this. I sort of pegged quitting my job to a\nlot of different metrics like \"we need this many students\" or \"we should have\nhired this many people\" or \"it should be 73 degrees in New York\" — I had a bunch\nof random metrics I pegged this to and at some point I realized it was a chicken\nand egg problem. We couldn't reach those metrics that we set until the\ncommitment was there. It varies from career to career. I worked at a very\nrigorous financial institution, I was up at 7:00 am, in the office by 8:15 am,\nand I left at 10:30 or 11:00 pm on a good day. For me to commit time outside of\nwork on a venture would mean midnight to 2:00 or 3:00 am. Eventually I gave\nmyself a deadline. I said, \"On this day I'm going to quit\", put it in my\ncalendar, and on that day I quit.\n\nSo what is the work-life balance like now?\nThe myth of entrepreneurship is that you set your own hours so there is\nwork-life balance that you can control. The truth, which very few people will\ntell you, is that your work life balance will get worse. But I think that’s due\nto the fact that work and life become the same thing for you. When you work a\ntraditional corporate job there is a clear distinction between work and life so\npeople can talk about the concept of work-life balance. When you start a company\nyour life is that company. At Horizons at least, we're happy about it.\n\nDoes it help that you're working with some of your best friends?\nOh yeah that helps a lot. If you work with people that you hate, you'll hate\nyour job and you career. I love working with my friends, and with like minded\npeople. Darwish and Lando\n[http://thesign.al/edward-lando-angel-investor-cofounder-at-horizons/]  are two\nof the only people who on a Saturday or Sunday night regularly will talk about\nideas in the office and how we can grow the company, and how we can make the\nproduct better, and how to help more students. You have to find more people who\nhave the same mindset and liking them makes it much easier.\n\nWhat is your advice for students in college?\nKeep in mind I'm not too far out from school. The best piece of advice I can\ngive is not to wait. There is an archetype in our minds of a successful person.\nIt’s generally someone who is 33 or 34 years old who has spent time in an\nindustry, who realizes there are all these problems, decides to go tackle one,\nand goes to build a company. Or it’s someone who climbs up the corporate ladder\nfor 15 to 20 years, becomes hyper successful, and goes and buys a house in the\nHamptons.\n\nThe biggest flaw with this is the notion you must wait to be successful, and\nwait to go out and try something. In school you have a sandbox you are playing\nin that is completely risk free. College is the most risk free four years of\nyour life. You can fail miserably and you'll be okay. You will never have that\ntime ever again. After college the clock starts ticking for real.\n\nWith that in mind would you have done something different in your college\nexperience?\nI took a year off from school but a lot of the things I was working on in my\nyear off felt ephemeral because I knew I had to come back to school. There is an\nincredible amount of value to being at universities and in college but when you\nhave the mindset of having to operate within the confines of a four year\nuniversity college education, you lose creativity. I stopped working on a very\nsuccessful company or idea because I felt I was limited to a year and had to go\nback to school.\n\nIf I was back in college I would've stayed out for a little bit longer. And I'm\nnot saying I would have dropped out of college but I just mean if things were\ngoing well I wouldn't have decided to come back just to come back. I would have\npursued whatever project I was working on and seen them through before coming\nback to school.\n\nHow do you filter out the noise when everyone around you is doing the same\nthing?\nIt's extremely difficult. Especially at a schools like Penn and Wharton there is\nan incredible amount of pressure to take part in the prevailing ecosystem, which\nis the banking and consulting ecosystem. Nobody can do it by themselves.\n\n==If you're the only guy or girl working on something and every other person\naround you is working on something else, it takes an incredible amount of mental\nstrength to keep doing that. You have to have a community. You have to have\nother people around you that support what you're doing and who feel the same\nway. Finding those people come from putting yourself in the right environment.\n==\n\nAny last words?\nWe've covered a lot. One thing I'd like to reiterate is this is your time to\nexperiment. You have little free time in your life to do so. It doesn't have to\nbe starting a company. Just do as much as you can to explore while you're still\nhere at school.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEditor’s Key Takeaways\n 1. College does not have to be a four year straight line experience. Explore\n    until you have the skills and perspective you need to do the work you want\n    to, this can take six months or six years.\n 2. An incredible amount of mental strength is necessary to filter out the noise\n    surrounding each and every one of us. We require community to persevere.\n 3. College is a risk free sandbox. Whoever said you must wait to be successful\n    and do your life's work was wrong.\n\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

She worked a few years for [McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/overview) before quitting and starting her JD/MBA dual degree program at Stanford University in 2009. Since her graduation, she’s been working at Facebook as a data scientist. \\n\\n*Editor: Alexandra and I got a chance to sit down for coffee a few weeks ago at the Starbucks on 34th and Walnut. Later that day, she gave a very passionate presentation on her career path and how she ended up at Facebook. Her perspective as someone who left her consulting days to work in the tech industry is very valuable to any student considering either paths.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Do you want to start off by giving an account of your time at Penn?**\\n\\nWhen I was at Penn, my whole thing was self-driving cars. I wanted there to be self-driving cars, in part because I didn’t particularly like driving and thought it was all very unsafe. I was basically taking all of the classes so that I would be able to take part in the self-driving car industry. When I got to my engineering orientation, they were telling us about all the different majors that we could do, I basically stood up and said, \\\"Hey! I wanted to do transportation. What kind of engineer am I?\\\" And they said that I was a systems engineer. And I said fair enough, and started to reverse engineer all my course planning so I would be able to take this one particular automation class.\\n\\n**How did that go?**\\n\\nI took all the transportation classes that were available in systems engineering, which mostly focused on public transportation because the professors did not like cars very much. Every time I took a class that was cross-listed in the mechanical engineering department, I got a bad grade in it. I was just not very good at mechanical engineering and the kind of thinking that was required to visualize things. I was fine in all the system engineering stuff, all the advanced linear algebra stuff, but I was not a visual learner. When I finally got to that automation class, I had spent so many hours working on an assignment that eventually turned in 50 pages and I still wasn't able to answer half the questions. The question that really convinced me [to stop pursuing mechanical engineering] was:\\n\\n *==Write an equation to parallel park a car.==* \\n\\nI couldn't parallel park a car in real life, I was completely incapable of visualizing how the wheels turned and at that moment, that I was like, \\\"You know what, I am never going to be able to help on the engineering side of automating vehicles.\\\" It is just not my gift, and I dropped the class. And I feel really bad for the TA that had to grade my 50 pages of crap.\\n\\n**What happened afterwards?**\\n\\nSo that was what I thought my whole career was going to be. Turned out to not quite be the case. Meanwhile, the second interest that I had was the entertainment industry. I'm hugely into TV, movies, and books. Without the entertainment industry, life is really just surviving. With my very few opportunities to take classes that did not fulfill my plentiful degree requirements, I managed to take Intro to Acting [[THAR 120](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/lpscourses/courses/term/2012C/subject/THAR/course/THAR120601)], a class on fairytales [[FOLK 206](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/folklore/courses/fall2006/folk306601.html)], and a Wharton class, randomly taught by a Shakespeare professor on the entertainment industry. We met a lot of guest speakers from different parts of the entertainment industry, and it was one of my favorite classes at Penn. We got to meet one of the producers of the Broadway productions of Wicked, which I was a huge fan of. \\n \\nI didn’t feel like I could go straight into entertainment (there wasn’t anyone at Penn to teach me how), so my plan at the time was to try to get to entertainment via consulting.  I really liked all my management classes and it’s what everyone else was doing, so there didn’t seem to be many downsides.  I went to McKinsey New York because I was told their Media & Entertainment practice was located in New York.\\n\\n**You've spent a few years in consulting. Do you have any advice for our audience currently considering it?**\\n\\nConsulting can teach valuable skills but for most people is extremely stressful.  You have very little control over your life, don’t get to be your authentic self (you’re a representative of the firm), and there is often no one looking out for you.  I personally was very unhappy in consulting, as were most of my friends, and do not recommend it to anyone.  Many consulting skills are available in books (e.g. [The McKinsey Edge](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26271798-the-mckinsey-edge), [Say it with Charts](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/243114.Say_It_with_Charts), [Case in Point](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/placementfocuscontent/books/Case+in+Point.pdf)) and I personally teach them at Facebook- you can get them from places other than management consulting firms.\\n\\n>==If you do go into consulting, find a partner at the consulting firm who is going to look out for you.==\\n\\nIf you’re interested in a particular area, find a partner in that area and meet with them as soon as possible after you join.  Tell them why you find their work interesting and ask what you can do to get staffed in that area as soon as possible. \\n \\nWhat you don’t want to have happen is to get a reputation for being good at something you don’t like  which happened to almost all my friends.  Whatever we were assigned to first, we got a reputation for being good at, and we weren’t allowed to leave.  The projects we wanted to be on (in my case, entertainment) didn’t want us because we had no relevant experience, and the projects we didn’t want (in my case, finance) wouldn’t take anyone but us.  A total Catch-22.  I was stuck in finance dying to get into entertainment, sitting next to a guy stuck in entertainment dying to get into finance.  By the end of three years I never got to work in entertainment, but I worked for five banks.  This was a very common experience.\\n\\n>==I know two people who had good experiences in consulting and were happy to go back to it after business school. I know over 60 former consultants.  **The math is not reassuring.**==\\n\\nSome of my MBA classmates went back to it just because it paid off their student loans, which is a ton of money and is pretty important. However, they were miserable when they went back and they could not wait to leave. Some of them could not even stick it out for the full two years to pay off all their loans. The numbers are not comforting when it comes to former consultants — how many had a good experience in consulting and would do it again, would recommend it for someone they cared about. And I can honestly say that from what I have heard, finance is not much better. I can also say from friends and personal experience that law is exactly the same thing — it's just for people who aren't as into math.  Consulting, finance, and law are all not all they’re advertised.  Be very clear about your goals and before you apply, talk to people already doing what you think you want to be doing and get their opinion. \\n\\n**Besides McKinsey, were there other career paths that you could have considered?**\\n\\nHonestly, if I could go back in time, I would definitely have tried to apply for Facebook. I would be a multi-millionaire and would not be working right now. I sometimes wonder — what if I had gone to LA and tried to make it in the entertainment industry from the ground up? I have a friend from my class who did exactly that, and now is writing for fairly major TV shows. That could have been a possibility. Going to work for an early tech company could have been a possibility. I should have put more effort into considering what my alternatives were.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"talk-to-people\\\"></div>\\n**What were some of your thoughts when you started the JD/MBA?**\\n\\nI encourage people to talk to others before they sign up for these kind of things, because I didn't do enough of that with the JD/MBA. I knew that I wanted to do the MBA, which was basically more Wharton. Everyone who went into consulting would go into MBA afterwards — either right away, or they would go do a bit of private equity first. Again, it was where the entire group was going, so it seemed like something that didn't have any downside attached to it. I did not fully appreciate how burdensome the student loans would be afterwards, and I didn’t do a good job of figuring out what the opportunity cost would be. Nevertheless, getting an MBA was a very easy choice for me, and I don't regret it. \\n\\n>==I knew what I wanted to get out of the MBA: I wanted exposure to the startup and entertainment industries, and I wanted to figure out what would be the good next steps for me.==\\n\\nLaw school is where I screwed up. And the reason why I went to law school was because people had told me my entire life that I could be a really good lawyer. I liked arguing people, I liked debating, I liked full sentences, which are things we are not allowed to do in consulting. I was exceptionally logical and detail-oriented, and a little bit cynical. I have the right skill-set for law. But the only two lawyers that I talked to before applying to law school were teachers at Wharton and I should have thought about that a little more. Why are they teaching at Wharton instead of being full-time lawyers? I did not talk to many people who were in big law at the time. \\n\\nIf you are going to a top tier law school, which you want to because it’s much more important for law school than business school to go to a top tier, in my opinion, you are going to have to get a really well paying job to pay off the enormous loans — which means going into big law. If I had talked to people from big law, I would have figured out right away that it has all the same crappy parts as management consulting. While I was in law school, I was trying to focus on areas that I was interested in. For example, I took a class on \\\"Entertainment Law and Intellectual Property Law\\\". But these were all things that I would have studied for funsies and not paid $200,000 for. \\n\\nIf I had talked to lawyers, I could have saved two years of my life and a ton of money. Now, anything I apply to, I try to talk to someone who is doing it first. When I graduated from MBA, I talked to dozens of Stanford grads who were working in the entertainment and tech industries to get an idea of what was good and what was not. For Facebook, I talked to a friend who was not a data scientist at Facebook, but had been at Facebook for several years, and she told me that it was a very great company to work for, and that has turned out to be entirely true.\\n\\n\\n**You talk a lot about your interests in the entertainment industry, what made you decide not to go into the industry after interning at Lionsgate?** \\n\\n*Editor's note: [Lionsgate](http://www.lionsgate.com/corporate/) is a media company known for producing \\\"Mad Men\\\", \\\"The Hunger Games\\\" series, and the \\\"Twilight\\\" series.*\\n\\nIt was like management consulting version two but you get paid less. I had wanted to do more of the creative side of entertainment and actually produce. What I figured out was the studios would hire me to do math for them. It wasn't even the type of math that I wanted to do for them. I would have still found it very interesting to do data science for the studios and figure out what movie they should be making, but the type of math that they wanted done was finance-type math. Like, \\\"We are considering buying the distribution rights to this property, can you value this for us?\\\" Those are the questions that I don't find very interesting. The ones that are interesting are looking at what affects whether or not the movie will be successful creatively, so we can make better movies. That wasn't what most of the strategy stuff for movie studios was going to be.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"quit\\\"></div>\\n**What are some of your recommendations for Penn?**\\n\\nAlways be ready to step back and look at how you're spending your time. \\n>==Of my activities, if I am not already doing this, would I keep doing it? The best things I did at Penn were **quitting** things.== \\n\\nI went into Penn having played french horn from sixth grade and up, so I went straight into the wind ensemble and became the co-president. I finally got into an argument with the director at Penn when he said, \\\"You know what, I don't actually think you like playing French horn.\\\" It was absolutely stunning for me. Then I thought about it for about two seconds, and I said:\\n\\n>==I think you're right. I **quit**.==\\n\\nBest decision I made at Penn.   My life would have been way different had I come in freshman year and said you know what, “Screw french horn, I'm gonna go join Bloomers or the debate team.\\\" I could have pursued other interests and allowed myself to branch out and try new things. You always have to be really conscious of sunk cost, and look around and say, is this actually making me happy and leading me to be where I want to be in the long run. Often times it's not. \\n\\nThis is especially true in undergrad where you spend so much time building the resume for where you want to go next, you can end up doing some pretty stupid things. For example, when I was there, they were trying to start some business fraternity. Everyone was very hyped about this new thing, and it took me a week to discover that I did not enjoy working with the team and I quit. Great lesson: don't necessarily look at what the crowd is doing — just be honest with yourself, and say, \\\"Hey, does this sound like a good investment of my time?\\\"\\n\\n>==Be really honest with yourself about what you are going to actually enjoy, because you want to find the intersection of the Venn diagram of what you enjoy, what you are good at, and what people will pay you for. And people tend to leave out the \\\"what I will enjoy\\\" part at Penn.==\\n\\n<!--Editor’s note: You can find her Venn Diagram in her slides attached.-->\\n\\n<div id=\\\"pie-eating\\\"></div>\\n**Did you do anything different in grad school?**\\n\\nIn grad school, I did it right this time. When I got to law school, everyone was like, \\\"Oh my gawd, law review, law review, I have to be on a law review.\\\" And by the end of my first semester, I figured out that I didn't actually want to be a lawyer. If you manage to get past the crazy application process, then you just get a ton of work to do for several years. Screw that, not doing it. So the only extracurriculars that I did in my grad school education were the musicals — the law school musical and the business school musical. \\n>==Frankly, it may not be obvious how directly those will impact my future career. But, I believe that they will and they made me really happy. ==\\n\\nYou can go on YouTube today and find [Jay Gatsby OS&M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyMFqWgC9aw)  which is a parody that I wrote for our optimization simulation and modeling class based off of Rihanna's song S&M, and it is the dirtiest song ever about math. And I am so proud that I helped create that. \\n\\nMy strong recommendation is to **screw FOMO [fear of missing out], screw what you think you need to do to build your resume, because chances are if you are doing something to just build your resume, it's a pie-eating contest.** It will get you more opportunities you don't actually have a good chance of enjoying.\\n\\nMy biggest recommendation for people who want to have a better time at Penn: quit something.\\n\\n*Editor's Note: Here's the [video](https://youtu.be/zyMFqWgC9aw) that Alexandra is referring to. It's really, really good.*\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zyMFqWgC9aw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n**Can you talk about some of the things that you learned outside of school that was meaningful?**\\n\\nTwo subjects that are not taught at Penn back in the day, that I strongly recommend that every Penn kid read and work on during their personal time:\\n\\n**1: Soft Skills.** There are not nearly enough classes at Wharton for undergrad on things like how do you talk to strangers, or how do you influence people who have no reason to help you. Wharton still has the negotiations class [[OIDD291](file://whartondrive/lihe$/2016AMGMT291406.pdf)], which is the closest that they have, but they should have something along the lines of how do you have an effective meeting. They give us all these classes that require group projects, but apart from Management 100, they don't actually go into much detail on how you create the psychological safety net that is necessary for a well-functioning group? Frankly when it's your very first semester of college, you don't have the experience to understand how to actually work effectively in a team, so I wish they had a senior version of Management 100. After you have all of this experience of working with other people, revisit a lot of the Management 100 content. Then we can ask, what does this actually mean out in the real world? How does this work in the real world? \\n\\n*Editor's note: Wharton recently changed their curriculum to do exactly this — MGMT100 will be replaced by Wharton 101, in which students won't pursue a lengthy, team-based project until senior year.*\\n\\n**2: Personal Finance.** I TA-ed a finance class at Wharton, and I didn't know a damn thing about personal finance when I left college and that was a shame. If I had, I would have understood much better what kind of student loans I was getting myself into, and the practical implications that would have on my quality of life after school. Check out \\\"[Rich Dad Poor Dad](http://4motivi.com/books/robert/rich.pdf)\\\", Dave Ramsey's \\\"[Total Money Makeover](http://experiencelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/The-Total-Money-Makeover.pdf)\\\", and Tony Robbin's \\\"[Money: Master the game](http://1.droppdf.com/files/1eoOq/money-master-the-game-7-simple-steps-to-f-robbins-tony.pdf)\\\". If you read those three books, you will be in such a better position financially than many, many of my peers when you hit my age.\\n\\n**Thought process behind becoming a data scientist?**\\n\\nOh, mostly by accident. I'm going to tell you why I'm a good data scientist. To give you a little more detail about why I applied for the data scientist role, know that it was called a product analytics role then. I took a very fun class at Wharton, called Product Launch [[OIDD415](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943)], that was taught by [Karl Ulrich](http://www.ktulrich.com/). Product Launch was super fun for me, and analytics is something that I’m really good at. Data science at Facebook let me use what I’m good at, and let me dabble in what I find really fun. Product analytics is basically me doing math to tell the designer how we should build our products. It captured a few important things for me: \\n\\n1) It let me touch product design. \\n2) It let me play towards my analytical strength. \\n3) Facebook can afford my massive student debt.\\n\\n*Editor’s note: [Professor Ulrich](http://www.ktulrich.com/) is still teaching the same class now called \\\"Product Design\\\"* [[OIDD415](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943)]*. It's my favorite class this semester, and Professor Ulrich is one of the most engaging professors I've had at Penn. If you can, sit in on his lectures Tuesdays 3:00pm to 4:30pm in Stiteler Hall B6. They are very well-structured.*\\n\\n\\n**What is a reality about your job that students should know before considering it?**\\n\\nNot just about my job, but in general:\\n>==Every job sucks. Every company sucks. You just get to choose how yours suck.==\\n\\nI can tell you that the thing that probably sucks the most about my job was I ended up working too many nights on the weekends because I couldn't concentrate in the open office. So what have I done? I have built up a lot of credibility that I can actually get my work done, I worked with my manager to figure out how I can work from home a few days a week. I'm actually talking to you from my kitchen right now. And hopefully that would make my job suck less. For any job, just figure out what are the things that are going to fill you up, and what are going to wear you down? Put together, are these things sustainable?\\n\\n**If I were to consider a role for data science at Facebook, what could I be doing right now?**\\n\\nLearn SQL. The other general tip: being an active product user (the way that people told you to be an “active reader” growing up). Any time that you catch yourself being frustrated with something, ask yourself, \\\"Why is this frustrating me? Is this actually a solvable problem?\\\" That is how you develop product sense: being able to have empathy for the user. \\n\\n*Editor's note: OIDD105 is a great course for SQL. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) is also a good online challenge-based learning program for SQL.*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"sleep\\\"></div>\\n**Anything else that you want to share?**\\n\\nThe one last tip-bit: **sleep**. When I was in your shoes, I didn't sleep nearly enough, and I thought I could get away with that forever. To this day, I have moderate to severe medical problems because I did not take care of my body. I encourage every student at Penn to track how much sleep they are getting, figure out how much sleep they should be getting and find a way to make close that gap. There's a lot of research on this stuff nowadays. Arianna Huffington just published a book called [\\\"Sleeping Your Way to the Top: How to Get the Sleep You Need to Succeed\\\"](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/sleep-your-way-to-the-top-ed020054d39b#.h5htpc1kp), about how to get enough sleep that your brain can function at its best. \\n>==Even as an almost 33-year-old professional with basically four Ivy League degrees, on my refrigerator, there's a calendar with smiley-face stickers to mark that I got enough sleep this week.==\\n\\nI read [\\\"Smarter, Faster, Better\\\"](http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/smarter-faster-better/) and they talk about how physically manipulating data actually gets us to process it better as human beings. So stickers on walls — they make a difference.\\n\\n**And how many smileys do you see right now?**\\n\\nThis month has been awesome, I'm four for four right now. \\n\\n*Editor's Update for March:*\\n\\n![](/content/images/2017/04/alexandra-s-calendar.jpg)\\n---\\n\\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

I wanted there to be self-driving cars, in part because I didn’t particularly like driving and thought it was all very unsafe. I was basically taking all of the classes so that I would be able to take part in the self-driving car industry. When I got to my engineering orientation, they were telling us about all the different majors that we could do, I basically stood up and said, &quot;Hey! I wanted to do transportation. What kind of engineer am I?&quot; And they said that I was a systems engineer. And I said fair enough, and started to reverse engineer all my course planning so I would be able to take this one particular automation class.</p>\n<p><strong>How did that go?</strong></p>\n<p>I took all the transportation classes that were available in systems engineering, which mostly focused on public transportation because the professors did not like cars very much. Every time I took a class that was cross-listed in the mechanical engineering department, I got a bad grade in it. I was just not very good at mechanical engineering and the kind of thinking that was required to visualize things. I was fine in all the system engineering stuff, all the advanced linear algebra stuff, but I was not a visual learner. When I finally got to that automation class, I had spent so many hours working on an assignment that eventually turned in 50 pages and I still wasn't able to answer half the questions. The question that really convinced me [to stop pursuing mechanical engineering] was:</p>\n<p><em><mark>Write an equation to parallel park a car.</mark></em></p>\n<p>I couldn't parallel park a car in real life, I was completely incapable of visualizing how the wheels turned and at that moment, that I was like, &quot;You know what, I am never going to be able to help on the engineering side of automating vehicles.&quot; It is just not my gift, and I dropped the class.

While I was in law school, I was trying to focus on areas that I was interested in. For example, I took a class on &quot;Entertainment Law and Intellectual Property Law&quot;. But these were all things that I would have studied for funsies and not paid $200,000 for.</p>\n<p>If I had talked to lawyers, I could have saved two years of my life and a ton of money. Now, anything I apply to, I try to talk to someone who is doing it first. When I graduated from MBA, I talked to dozens of Stanford grads who were working in the entertainment and tech industries to get an idea of what was good and what was not. For Facebook, I talked to a friend who was not a data scientist at Facebook, but had been at Facebook for several years, and she told me that it was a very great company to work for, and that has turned out to be entirely true.</p>\n<p><strong>You talk a lot about your interests in the entertainment industry, what made you decide not to go into the industry after interning at Lionsgate?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Editor's note: <a href=\"http://www.lionsgate.com/corporate/\">Lionsgate</a> is a media company known for producing &quot;Mad Men&quot;, &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; series, and the &quot;Twilight&quot; series.</em></p>\n<p>It was like management consulting version two but you get paid less. I had wanted to do more of the creative side of entertainment and actually produce. What I figured out was the studios would hire me to do math for them. It wasn't even the type of math that I wanted to do for them. I would have still found it very interesting to do data science for the studios and figure out what movie they should be making, but the type of math that they wanted done was finance-type math. Like, &quot;We are considering buying the distribution rights to this property, can you value this for us?&quot; Those are the questions that I don't find very interesting. The ones that are interesting are looking at what affects whether or not the movie will be successful creatively, so we can make better movies.

Wharton still has the negotiations class [[OIDD291](file://whartondrive/lihe$/2016AMGMT291406.pdf)], which is the closest that they have, but they should have something along the lines of how do you have an effective meeting. They give us all these classes that require group projects, but apart from Management 100, they don't actually go into much detail on how you create the psychological safety net that is necessary for a well-functioning group? Frankly when it's your very first semester of college, you don't have the experience to understand how to actually work effectively in a team, so I wish they had a senior version of Management 100. After you have all of this experience of working with other people, revisit a lot of the Management 100 content. Then we can ask, what does this actually mean out in the real world? How does this work in the real world?</p>\n<p><em>Editor's note: Wharton recently changed their curriculum to do exactly this — MGMT100 will be replaced by Wharton 101, in which students won't pursue a lengthy, team-based project until senior year.</em></p>\n<p><strong>2: Personal Finance.</strong> I TA-ed a finance class at Wharton, and I didn't know a damn thing about personal finance when I left college and that was a shame. If I had, I would have understood much better what kind of student loans I was getting myself into, and the practical implications that would have on my quality of life after school. Check out &quot;<a href=\"http://4motivi.com/books/robert/rich.pdf\">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a>&quot;, Dave Ramsey's &quot;<a href=\"http://experiencelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/The-Total-Money-Makeover.pdf\">Total Money Makeover</a>&quot;, and Tony Robbin's &quot;<a href=\"http://1.droppdf.com/files/1eoOq/money-master-the-game-7-simple-steps-to-f-robbins-tony.pdf\">Money: Master the game</a>&quot;. If you read those three books, you will be in such a better position financially than many, many of my peers when you hit my age.</p>\n<p><strong>Thought process behind becoming a data scientist?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, mostly by accident. I'm going to tell you why I'm a good data scientist. To give you a little more detail about why I applied for the data scientist role, know that it was called a product analytics role then. I took a very fun class at Wharton, called Product Launch [<a href=\"https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943\">OIDD415</a>], that was taught by <a href=\"http://www.ktulrich.com/\">Karl Ulrich</a>. Product Launch was super fun for me, and analytics is something that I’m really good at. Data science at Facebook let me use what I’m good at, and let me dabble in what I find really fun. Product analytics is basically me doing math to tell the designer how we should build our products. It captured a few important things for me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It let me touch product design.</li>\n<li>It let me play towards my analytical strength.</li>\n<li>Facebook can afford my massive student debt.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: <a href=\"http://www.ktulrich.com/\">Professor Ulrich</a> is still teaching the same class now called &quot;Product Design&quot;</em> [<a href=\"https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943\">OIDD415</a>]<em>. It's my favorite class this semester, and Professor Ulrich is one of the most engaging professors I've had at Penn. If you can, sit in on his lectures Tuesdays 3:00pm to 4:30pm in Stiteler Hall B6. They are very well-structured.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What is a reality about your job that students should know before considering it?</strong></p>\n<p>Not just about my job, but in general:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>Every job sucks. Every company sucks. You just get to choose how yours suck.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can tell you that the thing that probably sucks the most about my job was I ended up working too many nights on the weekends because I couldn't concentrate in the open office. So what have I done? I have built up a lot of credibility that I can actually get my work done, I worked with my manager to figure out how I can work from home a few days a week. I'm actually talking to you from my kitchen right now. And hopefully that would make my job suck less. For any job, just figure out what are the things that are going to fill you up, and what are going to wear you down? Put together, are these things sustainable?</p>\n<p><strong>If I were to consider a role for data science at Facebook, what could I be doing right now?</strong></p>\n<p>Learn SQL. The other general tip: being an active product user (the way that people told you to be an “active reader” growing up). Any time that you catch yourself being frustrated with something, ask yourself, &quot;Why is this frustrating me? Is this actually a solvable problem?&quot; That is how you develop product sense: being able to have empathy for the user.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's note: OIDD105 is a great course for SQL. <a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql\">HackerRank</a> is also a good online challenge-based learning program for SQL.</em></p>\n<div id=\"sleep\"></div>\n**Anything else that you want to share?**\n<p>The one last tip-bit: <strong>sleep</strong>. When I was in your shoes, I didn't sleep nearly enough, and I thought I could get away with that forever. To this day, I have moderate to severe medical problems because I did not take care of my body. I encourage every student at Penn to track how much sleep they are getting, figure out how much sleep they should be getting and find a way to make close that gap. There's a lot of research on this stuff nowadays. Arianna Huffington just published a book called <a href=\"https://journal.thriveglobal.com/sleep-your-way-to-the-top-ed020054d39b#.h5htpc1kp\">&quot;Sleeping Your Way to the Top: How to Get the Sleep You Need to Succeed&quot;</a>, about how to get enough sleep that your brain can function at its best.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>Even as an almost 33-year-old professional with basically four Ivy League degrees, on my refrigerator, there's a calendar with smiley-face stickers to mark that I got enough sleep this week.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read <a href=\"http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/smarter-faster-better/\">&quot;Smarter, Faster, Better&quot;</a> and they talk about how physically manipulating data actually gets us to process it better as human beings. So stickers on walls — they make a difference.</p>\n<p><strong>And how many smileys do you see right now?</strong></p>\n<p>This month has been awesome, I'm four for four right now.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's Update for March:</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"\"><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/alexandra-s-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"\"></h2>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

Sleep more.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlexandra Ressler graduated from the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and\nTechnology at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006. She worked a few years for\n McKinsey [http://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/overview]  before quitting and\nstarting her JD/MBA dual degree program at Stanford University in 2009. Since\nher graduation, she’s been working at Facebook as a data scientist.\n\nEditor: Alexandra and I got a chance to sit down for coffee a few weeks ago at\nthe Starbucks on 34th and Walnut. Later that day, she gave a very passionate\npresentation on her career path and how she ended up at Facebook. Her\nperspective as someone who left her consulting days to work in the tech industry\nis very valuable to any student considering either paths.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo you want to start off by giving an account of your time at Penn?\n\nWhen I was at Penn, my whole thing was self-driving cars. I wanted there to be\nself-driving cars, in part because I didn’t particularly like driving and\nthought it was all very unsafe. I was basically taking all of the classes so\nthat I would be able to take part in the self-driving car industry. When I got\nto my engineering orientation, they were telling us about all the different\nmajors that we could do, I basically stood up and said, \"Hey! I wanted to do\ntransportation. What kind of engineer am I?\" And they said that I was a systems\nengineer. And I said fair enough, and started to reverse engineer all my course\nplanning so I would be able to take this one particular automation class.\n\nHow did that go?\n\nI took all the transportation classes that were available in systems\nengineering, which mostly focused on public transportation because the\nprofessors did not like cars very much. Every time I took a class that was\ncross-listed in the mechanical engineering department, I got a bad grade in it.\nI was just not very good at mechanical engineering and the kind of thinking that\nwas required to visualize things. I was fine in all the system engineering\nstuff, all the advanced linear algebra stuff, but I was not a visual learner.\nWhen I finally got to that automation class, I had spent so many hours working\non an assignment that eventually turned in 50 pages and I still wasn't able to\nanswer half the questions. The question that really convinced me [to stop\npursuing mechanical engineering] was:\n\nWrite an equation to parallel park a car.\n\nI couldn't parallel park a car in real life, I was completely incapable of\nvisualizing how the wheels turned and at that moment, that I was like, \"You know\nwhat, I am never going to be able to help on the engineering side of automating\nvehicles.\" It is just not my gift, and I dropped the class. And I feel really\nbad for the TA that had to grade my 50 pages of crap.\n\nWhat happened afterwards?\n\nSo that was what I thought my whole career was going to be. Turned out to not\nquite be the case. Meanwhile, the second interest that I had was the\nentertainment industry. I'm hugely into TV, movies, and books. Without the\nentertainment industry, life is really just surviving. With my very few\nopportunities to take classes that did not fulfill my plentiful degree\nrequirements, I managed to take Intro to Acting [THAR 120\n[https://www.sas.upenn.edu/lpscourses/courses/term/2012C/subject/THAR/course/THAR120601]\n], a class on fairytales [FOLK 206\n[http://www.sas.upenn.edu/folklore/courses/fall2006/folk306601.html]], and a\nWharton class, randomly taught by a Shakespeare professor on the entertainment\nindustry. We met a lot of guest speakers from different parts of the\nentertainment industry, and it was one of my favorite classes at Penn. We got to\nmeet one of the producers of the Broadway productions of Wicked, which I was a\nhuge fan of.\n\nI didn’t feel like I could go straight into entertainment (there wasn’t anyone\nat Penn to teach me how), so my plan at the time was to try to get to\nentertainment via consulting. I really liked all my management classes and it’s\nwhat everyone else was doing, so there didn’t seem to be many downsides. I went\nto McKinsey New York because I was told their Media & Entertainment practice was\nlocated in New York.\n\nYou've spent a few years in consulting. Do you have any advice for our audience\ncurrently considering it?\n\nConsulting can teach valuable skills but for most people is extremely stressful.\nYou have very little control over your life, don’t get to be your authentic self\n(you’re a representative of the firm), and there is often no one looking out for\nyou. I personally was very unhappy in consulting, as were most of my friends,\nand do not recommend it to anyone. Many consulting skills are available in books\n(e.g. The McKinsey Edge\n[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26271798-the-mckinsey-edge], Say it with\nCharts [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/243114.Say_It_with_Charts], Case in\nPoint\n[https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/placementfocuscontent/books/Case+in+Point.pdf]\n) and I personally teach them at Facebook- you can get them from places other\nthan management consulting firms.\n\nIf you do go into consulting, find a partner at the consulting firm who is going\nto look out for you.\n\nIf you’re interested in a particular area, find a partner in that area and meet\nwith them as soon as possible after you join. Tell them why you find their work\ninteresting and ask what you can do to get staffed in that area as soon as\npossible.\n\nWhat you don’t want to have happen is to get a reputation for being good at\nsomething you don’t like which happened to almost all my friends. Whatever we\nwere assigned to first, we got a reputation for being good at, and we weren’t\nallowed to leave. The projects we wanted to be on (in my case, entertainment)\ndidn’t want us because we had no relevant experience, and the projects we didn’t\nwant (in my case, finance) wouldn’t take anyone but us. A total Catch-22. I was\nstuck in finance dying to get into entertainment, sitting next to a guy stuck in\nentertainment dying to get into finance. By the end of three years I never got\nto work in entertainment, but I worked for five banks. This was a very common\nexperience.\n\nI know two people who had good experiences in consulting and were happy to go\nback to it after business school. I know over 60 former consultants. The math is\nnot reassuring.\n\nSome of my MBA classmates went back to it just because it paid off their student\nloans, which is a ton of money and is pretty important. However, they were\nmiserable when they went back and they could not wait to leave. Some of them\ncould not even stick it out for the full two years to pay off all their loans.\nThe numbers are not comforting when it comes to former consultants — how many\nhad a good experience in consulting and would do it again, would recommend it\nfor someone they cared about. And I can honestly say that from what I have\nheard, finance is not much better. I can also say from friends and personal\nexperience that law is exactly the same thing — it's just for people who aren't\nas into math. Consulting, finance, and law are all not all they’re advertised.\nBe very clear about your goals and before you apply, talk to people already\ndoing what you think you want to be doing and get their opinion.\n\nBesides McKinsey, were there other career paths that you could have considered?\n\nHonestly, if I could go back in time, I would definitely have tried to apply for\nFacebook. I would be a multi-millionaire and would not be working right now. I\nsometimes wonder — what if I had gone to LA and tried to make it in the\nentertainment industry from the ground up? I have a friend from my class who did\nexactly that, and now is writing for fairly major TV shows. That could have been\na possibility. Going to work for an early tech company could have been a\npossibility. I should have put more effort into considering what my alternatives\nwere.\n\n**What were some of your thoughts when you started the JD/MBA?**I encourage\npeople to talk to others before they sign up for these kind of things, because I\ndidn't do enough of that with the JD/MBA. I knew that I wanted to do the MBA,\nwhich was basically more Wharton. Everyone who went into consulting would go\ninto MBA afterwards — either right away, or they would go do a bit of private\nequity first. Again, it was where the entire group was going, so it seemed like\nsomething that didn't have any downside attached to it. I did not fully\nappreciate how burdensome the student loans would be afterwards, and I didn’t do\na good job of figuring out what the opportunity cost would be. Nevertheless,\ngetting an MBA was a very easy choice for me, and I don't regret it.\n\nI knew what I wanted to get out of the MBA: I wanted exposure to the startup and\nentertainment industries, and I wanted to figure out what would be the good next\nsteps for me.\n\nLaw school is where I screwed up. And the reason why I went to law school was\nbecause people had told me my entire life that I could be a really good lawyer.\nI liked arguing people, I liked debating, I liked full sentences, which are\nthings we are not allowed to do in consulting. I was exceptionally logical and\ndetail-oriented, and a little bit cynical. I have the right skill-set for law.\nBut the only two lawyers that I talked to before applying to law school were\nteachers at Wharton and I should have thought about that a little more. Why are\nthey teaching at Wharton instead of being full-time lawyers? I did not talk to\nmany people who were in big law at the time.\n\nIf you are going to a top tier law school, which you want to because it’s much\nmore important for law school than business school to go to a top tier, in my\nopinion, you are going to have to get a really well paying job to pay off the\nenormous loans — which means going into big law. If I had talked to people from\nbig law, I would have figured out right away that it has all the same crappy\nparts as management consulting. While I was in law school, I was trying to focus\non areas that I was interested in. For example, I took a class on \"Entertainment\nLaw and Intellectual Property Law\". But these were all things that I would have\nstudied for funsies and not paid $200,000 for.\n\nIf I had talked to lawyers, I could have saved two years of my life and a ton of\nmoney. Now, anything I apply to, I try to talk to someone who is doing it first.\nWhen I graduated from MBA, I talked to dozens of Stanford grads who were working\nin the entertainment and tech industries to get an idea of what was good and\nwhat was not. For Facebook, I talked to a friend who was not a data scientist at\nFacebook, but had been at Facebook for several years, and she told me that it\nwas a very great company to work for, and that has turned out to be entirely\ntrue.\n\nYou talk a lot about your interests in the entertainment industry, what made you\ndecide not to go into the industry after interning at Lionsgate?\n\nEditor's note: Lionsgate [http://www.lionsgate.com/corporate/]  is a media\ncompany known for producing \"Mad Men\", \"The Hunger Games\" series, and the\n\"Twilight\" series.\n\nIt was like management consulting version two but you get paid less. I had\nwanted to do more of the creative side of entertainment and actually produce.\nWhat I figured out was the studios would hire me to do math for them. It wasn't\neven the type of math that I wanted to do for them. I would have still found it\nvery interesting to do data science for the studios and figure out what movie\nthey should be making, but the type of math that they wanted done was\nfinance-type math. Like, \"We are considering buying the distribution rights to\nthis property, can you value this for us?\" Those are the questions that I don't\nfind very interesting. The ones that are interesting are looking at what affects\nwhether or not the movie will be successful creatively, so we can make better\nmovies. That wasn't what most of the strategy stuff for movie studios was going\nto be.\n\n**What are some of your recommendations for Penn?**Always be ready to step back\nand look at how you're spending your time.\n\nOf my activities, if I am not already doing this, would I keep doing it? The\nbest things I did at Penn were quitting  things.\n\nI went into Penn having played french horn from sixth grade and up, so I went\nstraight into the wind ensemble and became the co-president. I finally got into\nan argument with the director at Penn when he said, \"You know what, I don't\nactually think you like playing French horn.\" It was absolutely stunning for me.\nThen I thought about it for about two seconds, and I said:\n\nI think you're right. I quit.\n\nBest decision I made at Penn. My life would have been way different had I come\nin freshman year and said you know what, “Screw french horn, I'm gonna go join\nBloomers or the debate team.\" I could have pursued other interests and allowed\nmyself to branch out and try new things. You always have to be really conscious\nof sunk cost, and look around and say, is this actually making me happy and\nleading me to be where I want to be in the long run. Often times it's not.\n\nThis is especially true in undergrad where you spend so much time building the\nresume for where you want to go next, you can end up doing some pretty stupid\nthings. For example, when I was there, they were trying to start some business\nfraternity. Everyone was very hyped about this new thing, and it took me a week\nto discover that I did not enjoy working with the team and I quit. Great lesson:\ndon't necessarily look at what the crowd is doing — just be honest with\nyourself, and say, \"Hey, does this sound like a good investment of my time?\"\n\nBe really honest with yourself about what you are going to actually enjoy,\nbecause you want to find the intersection of the Venn diagram of what you enjoy,\nwhat you are good at, and what people will pay you for. And people tend to leave\nout the \"what I will enjoy\" part at Penn.\n\n**Did you do anything different in grad school?**In grad school, I did it right\nthis time. When I got to law school, everyone was like, \"Oh my gawd, law review,\nlaw review, I have to be on a law review.\" And by the end of my first semester,\nI figured out that I didn't actually want to be a lawyer. If you manage to get\npast the crazy application process, then you just get a ton of work to do for\nseveral years. Screw that, not doing it. So the only extracurriculars that I did\nin my grad school education were the musicals — the law school musical and the\nbusiness school musical.\n\n==Frankly, it may not be obvious how directly those will impact my future\ncareer. But, I believe that they will and they made me really happy. ==\n\nYou can go on YouTube today and find Jay Gatsby OS&M\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyMFqWgC9aw]  which is a parody that I wrote\nfor our optimization simulation and modeling class based off of Rihanna's song\nS&M, and it is the dirtiest song ever about math. And I am so proud that I\nhelped create that.\n\nMy strong recommendation is to screw FOMO [fear of missing out], screw what you\nthink you need to do to build your resume, because chances are if you are doing\nsomething to just build your resume, it's a pie-eating contest.  It will get you\nmore opportunities you don't actually have a good chance of enjoying.\n\nMy biggest recommendation for people who want to have a better time at Penn:\nquit something.\n\nEditor's Note: Here's the video [https://youtu.be/zyMFqWgC9aw]  that Alexandra\nis referring to. It's really, really good.\n\nCan you talk about some of the things that you learned outside of school that\nwas meaningful?\n\nTwo subjects that are not taught at Penn back in the day, that I strongly\nrecommend that every Penn kid read and work on during their personal time:\n\n1: Soft Skills.  There are not nearly enough classes at Wharton for undergrad on\nthings like how do you talk to strangers, or how do you influence people who\nhave no reason to help you. Wharton still has the negotiations class\n[[OIDD291](file://whartondrive/lihe$/2016AMGMT291406.pdf)], which is the closest\nthat they have, but they should have something along the lines of how do you\nhave an effective meeting. They give us all these classes that require group\nprojects, but apart from Management 100, they don't actually go into much detail\non how you create the psychological safety net that is necessary for a\nwell-functioning group? Frankly when it's your very first semester of college,\nyou don't have the experience to understand how to actually work effectively in\na team, so I wish they had a senior version of Management 100. After you have\nall of this experience of working with other people, revisit a lot of the\nManagement 100 content. Then we can ask, what does this actually mean out in the\nreal world? How does this work in the real world?\n\nEditor's note: Wharton recently changed their curriculum to do exactly this —\nMGMT100 will be replaced by Wharton 101, in which students won't pursue a\nlengthy, team-based project until senior year.\n\n2: Personal Finance.  I TA-ed a finance class at Wharton, and I didn't know a\ndamn thing about personal finance when I left college and that was a shame. If I\nhad, I would have understood much better what kind of student loans I was\ngetting myself into, and the practical implications that would have on my\nquality of life after school. Check out \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\n[http://4motivi.com/books/robert/rich.pdf]\", Dave Ramsey's \"Total Money Makeover\n[http://experiencelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/The-Total-Money-Makeover.pdf]\n\", and Tony Robbin's \"Money: Master the game\n[http://1.droppdf.com/files/1eoOq/money-master-the-game-7-simple-steps-to-f-robbins-tony.pdf]\n\". If you read those three books, you will be in such a better position\nfinancially than many, many of my peers when you hit my age.\n\nThought process behind becoming a data scientist?\n\nOh, mostly by accident. I'm going to tell you why I'm a good data scientist. To\ngive you a little more detail about why I applied for the data scientist role,\nknow that it was called a product analytics role then. I took a very fun class\nat Wharton, called Product Launch [OIDD415\n[https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943]], that was taught by Karl Ulrich\n[http://www.ktulrich.com/]. Product Launch was super fun for me, and analytics\nis something that I’m really good at. Data science at Facebook let me use what\nI’m good at, and let me dabble in what I find really fun. Product analytics is\nbasically me doing math to tell the designer how we should build our products.\nIt captured a few important things for me:\n\n 1. It let me touch product design.\n 2. It let me play towards my analytical strength.\n 3. Facebook can afford my massive student debt.\n\nEditor’s note: Professor Ulrich [http://www.ktulrich.com/]  is still teaching\nthe same class now called \"Product Design\"  [OIDD415\n[https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943]]. It's my favorite class this\nsemester, and Professor Ulrich is one of the most engaging professors I've had\nat Penn. If you can, sit in on his lectures Tuesdays 3:00pm to 4:30pm in\nStiteler Hall B6. They are very well-structured.\n\nWhat is a reality about your job that students should know before considering\nit?\n\nNot just about my job, but in general:\n\nEvery job sucks. Every company sucks. You just get to choose how yours suck.\n\nI can tell you that the thing that probably sucks the most about my job was I\nended up working too many nights on the weekends because I couldn't concentrate\nin the open office. So what have I done? I have built up a lot of credibility\nthat I can actually get my work done, I worked with my manager to figure out how\nI can work from home a few days a week. I'm actually talking to you from my\nkitchen right now. And hopefully that would make my job suck less. For any job,\njust figure out what are the things that are going to fill you up, and what are\ngoing to wear you down? Put together, are these things sustainable?\n\nIf I were to consider a role for data science at Facebook, what could I be doing\nright now?\n\nLearn SQL. The other general tip: being an active product user (the way that\npeople told you to be an “active reader” growing up). Any time that you catch\nyourself being frustrated with something, ask yourself, \"Why is this frustrating\nme? Is this actually a solvable problem?\" That is how you develop product sense:\nbeing able to have empathy for the user.\n\nEditor's note: OIDD105 is a great course for SQL. HackerRank\n[https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql]  is also a good online challenge-based\nlearning program for SQL.\n\n**Anything else that you want to share?**The one last tip-bit: sleep. When I was in your shoes, I didn't sleep nearly\nenough, and I thought I could get away with that forever. To this day, I have\nmoderate to severe medical problems because I did not take care of my body. I\nencourage every student at Penn to track how much sleep they are getting, figure\nout how much sleep they should be getting and find a way to make close that gap.\nThere's a lot of research on this stuff nowadays. Arianna Huffington just\npublished a book called \"Sleeping Your Way to the Top: How to Get the Sleep You\nNeed to Succeed\", about how to get enough sleep that your brain can function at\nits best.\n\nEven as an almost 33-year-old professional with basically four Ivy League\ndegrees, on my refrigerator, there's a calendar with smiley-face stickers to\nmark that I got enough sleep this week.\n\nI read \"Smarter, Faster, Better\"\n[http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/smarter-faster-better/] \n and they talk about how physically manipulating data actually gets us to\nprocess it better as human beings. So stickers on walls — they make a\ndifference.\n\nAnd how many smileys do you see right now?\n\nThis month has been awesome, I'm four for four right now.\n\nEditor's Update for March:\n\n\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

I didn't even have an idea, but there's this one expert that had some experience in environmental policy in Cambodia, whom I requested; however, who also decided that Miami was a better way to spend her Tuesday. Fair enough. Instead, I got the pleasant experience of sitting down with Sara Haq, who was on a trip to Wharton to meet with students. After chatting about random topics, it was really clear that Sara had very extensive advice for anybody considering an international career. I decided request to interview her and here's what we learned.*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"small-interests\\\"></div>\\n**Before we start, would you like to share one cool thing that you think is important about you that I wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else?**\\n\\nActually, you can find a LOT about me online, especially on my blog on [my company website](http://www.shinternational.us). On a personal level, I really love to cook, and I really like to meet people. It's interesting how as an entrepreneur, you can work a little bit of your personal interests into everything that you do. Here's a funny story. I used to have a lot of food companies as clients, because I am really passionate about food and have a good sense of what types of foods will be popular in specific overseas markets. But a lot of their foods were really high calorie. So, with all of food samples I was evaluating, I started to gain weight, so I eventually stopped actively looking for new food companies to work with. So as an entrepreneur, your personal interests and preferences will start to intertwine with your business. \\n\\n**Can you talk broadly about your international experience?**\\n\\nWhen I worked for the [International Finance Corporation (IFC)](http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home), I had the opportunity to work with investments across Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, Central Asia and South Asia. I thought leaving the IFC meant that I would not have these opportunities anymore, but have been relieved to find out that this is not the case!\\n\\nSince leaving, I have had the chance to support women entrepreneurs and leaders in Tanzania, share insights at a [food investment conference in Uzbekistan](http://www.food-exhibitions.com/WorldFood-Uzbekistan), help US companies get partnerships in the United Arab Emirates and in Turkey, and even help foreign companies, like an Indian ICT company we helped position for entry into Central Asia. I helped a technology start-up build its presence in the Philippines. I even have a Swedish entrepreneur who is an enthusiastic client of our training programs. I love my job. \\n\\nThe only thing that is missing is that I need to support more entrepreneurs building a presence in Latin America, because that is my favorite region of the world to do business in. I feel like I just confessed a secret. I am not supposed to have favorites. I do have a Mexican-American entrepreneur on our advisory board, and have just started exploring leveraging the resources that he brings to the table to support an Ecuadorian entrepreneur living in the US, who wants to build a business involving “both of his countries.” \\n\\n\\n**Can you tell us about SH International? What is it? What do you enjoy about it?**\\n\\nSH International helps entrepreneurs build profitable multinational businesses. With access to the right expertise, deals, and relationships, entrepreneurs do not need to join the Fortune 500 before achieving profitable multinational business growth. These individuals are driven by passion and vision to build amazing global businesses outside of their current comfort zones and abilities. They do this by taking tangible steps towards achieving their goals, by attracting the resources that they need to survive and thrive, and by taking advantage of educational opportunities that fill critical gaps in their skill set. We support them in these endeavors.\\n\\nI enjoy almost everything about my business. Maybe what I enjoy the most is serving others of a kindred spirit. I love meeting entrepreneurs whose hunger for life and for experiencing the world compels them, over time, to push their comfort zones out to infinite.\\n\\n**Can you talk a bit about the difference between working abroad versus working in the US?**\\n\\nIn the US, people have a very systematic way of viewing the world. There are rules that you follow, and there are systems that you go through. There are regulations and guidelines. When you start doing international work, especially in emerging markets, there is not as much structure. A lot of people from the US struggle with the level of flexibility, and so-called out-of-the-box thinking necessary to survive and thrive. It can be a lot of fun to do international work with the right mind-set. In many situations, you can create your own structure, and be very creative and innovative, a perfect situation for the entrepreneurial type!\\n\\n**Were you entrepreneurial during your undergrad years?**\\n\\nNot entrepreneurial in the strict sense. I never took the entrepreneurship classes. I guess my tendency towards entrepreneurship shone through in the things that I did. For example, I was one of the five co-founders of [Phi Gamma Nu (PGN)](http://www.upenn-pgn.org/). I think I always had a streak of liking to get things done, to create something out of nothing. I liked executing so I would say yes to opportunities to be involved in something innovative or new, but I didn't take entrepreneurship courses, and I didn't do any business competitions.\\n\\n**Do you have any advice for college students on career paths?**\\n\\nAt the very beginning, my mentality was that there must be only one right answer to what I should do with my life. I used to think that you can calculate the path to take, and I searched for the right answer in investment banking or consulting. Within those, you do further soul searching to pick whether you are going to be a trader or serve in other specific functions.\\n\\nI used to study a lot of math. In elementary math, there was only one right answer. Either you got it right or you did not. However, as I dove into the more advanced math, sometimes there were multiple right answers to the problem. Or sometimes, there were no solutions. So, when considering what future route to take, I try to remind myself that life decisions are just like these math equations, and try not to put so much pressure on finding the one right answer. Just because you choose one answer does not necessary mean that you are right or wrong. You just made that specific decision.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"friends\\\"></div>\\n**How did you stay informed as to your opportunities along the way?**\\n\\nI interviewed with a lot of companies, not by choice, but because I needed to do that to get my first job. This experience gave me a lot of exposure to the type of work out there. I definitely encourage you to do a lot of interviewing, if for no other reason than the practice is helpful.\\n\\nI think at a place like Wharton, you are definitely busy. There are one million opportunities that all seem really important. You do not have the luxury to pursue every interesting opportunity, or to rigorously compare them. Following your curiosity and your strengths will allow you to naturally look at things that you are the most likely to be successful in.\\n\\nYou have to understand that you can spend a million hours, months, years, beating yourself up about the career decisions that you will have to make. And you will not find that one answer, because there are multiple answers. You can better use that psychological energy to get, for example, better grades, and meet more people.\\n\\n>==One thing I wish is that I had met more people as an undergrad. It’s such a gift to be in Wharton undergrad. You can build many genuine, sincere relationships with amazing people.==\\n\\nWhereas, in MBA programs, people are more intentionally there for the networking and connections. I believe that you get many more sincere friendships in undergrad. And now that I think back, all of those people are doing great things. And each of those can be a unique connection that can support you in the future, and whom you can support.\\n\\n**What is one specific project that really stuck in your mind all these years?**\\n\\nOne of my first projects was helping an Indian information and communication technology client, called [Karvy Data Management Services](http://www.kdms.in/home.html), position themselves to enter Central Asia.\\n \\nSo there were a couple of really cool things about this project. One, the client was Adhiraj Parthasarathy, who was also one of my friends from Penn undergrad. It was just really, really fun reconnecting with a friend from college, doing a really cool project for him and with him. I think the take-away from this is that if you do the things that you are interested in at Penn, you will be surrounded by people who are likely interested in the same things, and when you leave you will have a great community to share fun opportunities with. The project itself was really fun as well. I was involved in introducing them to a lot of partners in Central Asia. From an American point of view, that was an exceptionally challenging project. \\n\\nI have learned to hold onto people who are supportive, like Adhiraj, and to find ways to further engage with them. This project was many years ago. However, we still work together. Adhiraj currently sits on the advisory board for SH International, and has helped me out with a number of strategic initiatives.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"pre-reqs\\\"></div>\\n**Anything else that you want to share?**\\n\\nI have learned a lot in the last few years working with multinational entrepreneurs. \\n\\n>==I came into this game thinking that experience counted a lot more than it actually does. What I found out was that the desire to take action and get things done counts a lot more.==\\n\\nI have worked with so many entrepreneurs, all of whom have performed extraordinary feats without a ton of experience. If you allow a lack of experience to scare you, it is difficult to get much done.\\n\\n\\n --------\\n\\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

For the past\nfour years, Sara Haq has been building her own company, SH International LLC\n[http://www.shinternational.us/], which helps entrepreneurs build profitable\nmultinational businesses.\n\nEditor: I signed up for a session with the Experts in Residence\n[http://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/experts-in-residence/], a part of\nPenn Wharton Entrepreneurship that provides advice for budding student\nentrepreneurs. I didn't even have an idea, but there's this one expert that had\nsome experience in environmental policy in Cambodia, whom I requested; however,\nwho also decided that Miami was a better way to spend her Tuesday. Fair enough.\nInstead, I got the pleasant experience of sitting down with Sara Haq, who was on\na trip to Wharton to meet with students. After chatting about random topics, it\nwas really clear that Sara had very extensive advice for anybody considering an\ninternational career. I decided request to interview her and here's what we\nlearned.\n\n**Before we start, would you like to share one cool thing that you think is\nimportant about you that I wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else?**Actually,\nyou can find a LOT about me online, especially on my blog on my company website\n[http://www.shinternational.us]. On a personal level, I really love to cook, and\nI really like to meet people. It's interesting how as an entrepreneur, you can\nwork a little bit of your personal interests into everything that you do. Here's\na funny story. I used to have a lot of food companies as clients, because I am\nreally passionate about food and have a good sense of what types of foods will\nbe popular in specific overseas markets. But a lot of their foods were really\nhigh calorie. So, with all of food samples I was evaluating, I started to gain\nweight, so I eventually stopped actively looking for new food companies to work\nwith. So as an entrepreneur, your personal interests and preferences will start\nto intertwine with your business.\n\nCan you talk broadly about your international experience?\n\nWhen I worked for the International Finance Corporation (IFC)\n[http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home]\n, I had the opportunity to work with investments across Latin America, Eastern\nEurope, Africa, Central Asia and South Asia. I thought leaving the IFC meant\nthat I would not have these opportunities anymore, but have been relieved to\nfind out that this is not the case!\n\nSince leaving, I have had the chance to support women entrepreneurs and leaders\nin Tanzania, share insights at a food investment conference in Uzbekistan\n[http://www.food-exhibitions.com/WorldFood-Uzbekistan], help US companies get\npartnerships in the United Arab Emirates and in Turkey, and even help foreign\ncompanies, like an Indian ICT company we helped position for entry into Central\nAsia. I helped a technology start-up build its presence in the Philippines. I\neven have a Swedish entrepreneur who is an enthusiastic client of our training\nprograms. I love my job.\n\nThe only thing that is missing is that I need to support more entrepreneurs\nbuilding a presence in Latin America, because that is my favorite region of the\nworld to do business in. I feel like I just confessed a secret. I am not\nsupposed to have favorites. I do have a Mexican-American entrepreneur on our\nadvisory board, and have just started exploring leveraging the resources that he\nbrings to the table to support an Ecuadorian entrepreneur living in the US, who\nwants to build a business involving “both of his countries.”\n\nCan you tell us about SH International? What is it? What do you enjoy about it?\n\nSH International helps entrepreneurs build profitable multinational businesses.\nWith access to the right expertise, deals, and relationships, entrepreneurs do\nnot need to join the Fortune 500 before achieving profitable multinational\nbusiness growth. These individuals are driven by passion and vision to build\namazing global businesses outside of their current comfort zones and abilities.\nThey do this by taking tangible steps towards achieving their goals, by\nattracting the resources that they need to survive and thrive, and by taking\nadvantage of educational opportunities that fill critical gaps in their skill\nset. We support them in these endeavors.\n\nI enjoy almost everything about my business. Maybe what I enjoy the most is\nserving others of a kindred spirit. I love meeting entrepreneurs whose hunger\nfor life and for experiencing the world compels them, over time, to push their\ncomfort zones out to infinite.\n\nCan you talk a bit about the difference between working abroad versus working in\nthe US?\n\nIn the US, people have a very systematic way of viewing the world. There are\nrules that you follow, and there are systems that you go through. There are\nregulations and guidelines. When you start doing international work, especially\nin emerging markets, there is not as much structure. A lot of people from the US\nstruggle with the level of flexibility, and so-called out-of-the-box thinking\nnecessary to survive and thrive. It can be a lot of fun to do international work\nwith the right mind-set. In many situations, you can create your own structure,\nand be very creative and innovative, a perfect situation for the entrepreneurial\ntype!\n\nWere you entrepreneurial during your undergrad years?\n\nNot entrepreneurial in the strict sense. I never took the entrepreneurship\nclasses. I guess my tendency towards entrepreneurship shone through in the\nthings that I did. For example, I was one of the five co-founders of Phi Gamma\nNu (PGN) [http://www.upenn-pgn.org/]. I think I always had a streak of liking to\nget things done, to create something out of nothing. I liked executing so I\nwould say yes to opportunities to be involved in something innovative or new,\nbut I didn't take entrepreneurship courses, and I didn't do any business\ncompetitions.\n\nDo you have any advice for college students on career paths?\n\nAt the very beginning, my mentality was that there must be only one right answer\nto what I should do with my life. I used to think that you can calculate the\npath to take, and I searched for the right answer in investment banking or\nconsulting. Within those, you do further soul searching to pick whether you are\ngoing to be a trader or serve in other specific functions.\n\nI used to study a lot of math. In elementary math, there was only one right\nanswer. Either you got it right or you did not. However, as I dove into the more\nadvanced math, sometimes there were multiple right answers to the problem. Or\nsometimes, there were no solutions. So, when considering what future route to\ntake, I try to remind myself that life decisions are just like these math\nequations, and try not to put so much pressure on finding the one right answer.\nJust because you choose one answer does not necessary mean that you are right or\nwrong. You just made that specific decision.\n\n**How did you stay informed as to your opportunities along the way?**I\ninterviewed with a lot of companies, not by choice, but because I needed to do\nthat to get my first job. This experience gave me a lot of exposure to the type\nof work out there. I definitely encourage you to do a lot of interviewing, if\nfor no other reason than the practice is helpful.\n\nI think at a place like Wharton, you are definitely busy. There are one million\nopportunities that all seem really important. You do not have the luxury to\npursue every interesting opportunity, or to rigorously compare them. Following\nyour curiosity and your strengths will allow you to naturally look at things\nthat you are the most likely to be successful in.\n\nYou have to understand that you can spend a million hours, months, years,\nbeating yourself up about the career decisions that you will have to make. And\nyou will not find that one answer, because there are multiple answers. You can\nbetter use that psychological energy to get, for example, better grades, and\nmeet more people.\n\nOne thing I wish is that I had met more people as an undergrad. It’s such a gift\nto be in Wharton undergrad. You can build many genuine, sincere relationships\nwith amazing people.\n\nWhereas, in MBA programs, people are more intentionally there for the networking\nand connections. I believe that you get many more sincere friendships in\nundergrad. And now that I think back, all of those people are doing great\nthings. And each of those can be a unique connection that can support you in the\nfuture, and whom you can support.\n\nWhat is one specific project that really stuck in your mind all these years?\n\nOne of my first projects was helping an Indian information and communication\ntechnology client, called Karvy Data Management Services\n[http://www.kdms.in/home.html], position themselves to enter Central Asia.\n\nSo there were a couple of really cool things about this project. One, the client\nwas Adhiraj Parthasarathy, who was also one of my friends from Penn undergrad.\nIt was just really, really fun reconnecting with a friend from college, doing a\nreally cool project for him and with him. I think the take-away from this is\nthat if you do the things that you are interested in at Penn, you will be\nsurrounded by people who are likely interested in the same things, and when you\nleave you will have a great community to share fun opportunities with. The\nproject itself was really fun as well. I was involved in introducing them to a\nlot of partners in Central Asia. From an American point of view, that was an\nexceptionally challenging project.\n\nI have learned to hold onto people who are supportive, like Adhiraj, and to find\nways to further engage with them. This project was many years ago. However, we\nstill work together. Adhiraj currently sits on the advisory board for SH\nInternational, and has helped me out with a number of strategic initiatives.\n\n**Anything else that you want to share?**I have learned a lot in the last few\nyears working with multinational entrepreneurs.\n\nI came into this game thinking that experience counted a lot more than it\nactually does. What I found out was that the desire to take action and get\nthings done counts a lot more.\n\nI have worked with so many entrepreneurs, all of whom have performed\nextraordinary feats without a ton of experience. If you allow a lack of\nexperience to scare you, it is difficult to get much done.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

It is not always about scoping into your \\\"passion\\\" area.\\n\\n----\\n\\nAdam Stein graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 2005 with an MBA in Marketing. After graduation, he and co-founder Tom Arnold spent the next five years building [TerraPass](https://www.terrapass.com/) from the ground up. After a short break, they got together again and began building [Gridium](https://gridium.com/) six years ago. \\n\\n[TerraPass](https://www.terrapass.com/about-us/terrapass-difference) provides carbon offsetting products helping individuals and businesses reduce their climate impact. [Gridium](https://gridium.com/about/) makes software tools and platforms for modern buildings. Some of the tools include energy consumption data analytics and visualization, and maintenance tracking platforms.\\n\\n*Editor: TerraPass was the main topic of discussion during [one of the lectures](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1326945/files/folder/2016%20Spring%20-%20Slides%20and%20Handouts?preview=58928796) for one of my classes this semester, Product Design* [[OIDD415](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943)]*. This is the same course that I talked a lot about during [my interview with Facebook data scientist Alexandra Ressler](http://thesign.al/alexandra-ressler-data-scientist-at-facebook/). My interests in sustainability and consumer behavior motivated me to reach out and find Adam through the Penn Alumni Database, and he was surprisingly enthusiastic to share his experience. His aptitude towards recognizing opportunities and his inclination towards learning and building things allow him to bring a great perspective for anyone considering a career path in building products and entering new industries. It was also super rewarding for me to put a face and voice to what I learned from the lecture.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n<div id=\\\"make-transition\\\"></div>\\n**What did you do before your MBA at Penn?**\\n \\nBasically, I've been working in technology for all of my post-graduate career. I actually fell into it unintentionally as I was a Biology major in Stanford. At one point, I thought I was going to go get a Ph.D. in Biology and be a research scientist. It wasn't until towards the end of my senior year that I realize I not want to pursue that path. I should have probably thought harder about it sooner. But when I did take some intro computer science courses my senior year, I ended up enjoying it. So after graduating, I got a job at school working in the Medical Informatics Department, a sort of the bridge into computing. It was a lucky time to make that transition. It was in 1996, Netscape was recently released. Everything was blowing up. Despite the fact that I was kind of under-qualified and clueless, it actually wasn't that hard to get a job. \\n\\n![](/content/images/2017/04/medical_info.jpg)\\n\\n>==This just goes to show that you can make transitions anytime.==\\n\\nThat's what took me to Trilogy and gave me a great experience for getting a close up view of basically what a successful startup looks like: both good and bad aspects of that. I certainly had no prior understanding of startups in general, venture, any of these things that college students are probably much more naturally tuned to these days. Even though I went to Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, it wasn't part of my undergraduate experience. It was all very new to me. So after about three years at Trilogy, I went to TellMe which was another hot startup, truly in Silicon Valley not in Texas. I also transition that point from engineering to product management, which I got a feeling was my truer passion.\\n\\n*Editor's Note: Based in Texas, Trilogy is an enterprise software company that automates front office functions. Adam got to work with clients such as Lucent and General Motors.*\\n\\n**What got you *excited* and why did you decide on an MBA?**\\n \\nI enjoyed aspects of engineering; but what really got me excited was trying to solve problems for people. This involved a more holistic set of skills than coding. It involves talking to users and thinking broadly about the context of what they do day-to-day. There are also elements of interface design. These kind of things that I was most enthusiastic about. So TellMe was an opportunity to transition to product management. I did that for several years and then kind of burnt out. And that's where I was just before Wharton. I actually took over a year off at that point and traveled, a lovely self-indulgent thing to do if you ever have the opportunity to do it right, I say go for it.\\n\\n*Editor's Note: TellMe provides advanced telecom services to Fortune 500 companies, including AT&T, FedEx, and Merrill Lynch.*\\n \\n**Where did you get a chance to travel?**\\n \\nI spent six months in South America, so probably two months backpacking in Patagonia. I worked my way up, and spent a while in Ecuador. Then, I came home, applied for an MBA program and as soon as the application process was done, I took off again and spent another roughly six months or so of riding a bicycle across Southeast Asia and China.\\n\\n![](/content/images/2017/04/Patagonia.jpeg)\\n \\n**You started your first venture in school. Could you give me a quick summary as to what you think Terrapass was when it first started?**\\n\\n*Editor's Note: Adam's first venture emerged straight from the Product Design [[OIDD415]](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943) class. Professor Ulrich spent the majority of one semester bragging about Terrapass.*\\n\\n![](/content/images/2017/04/terrapass.png)\\n \\nSo Karl's class has changed over the years, and ours was the very first version of it. In this version, Karl came up with the basic idea. So that doesn't mean he designed the product or the go-to-market strategy or all of the other things that we have to do. The core of it was carbon offsets for consumers and that was handed to us. So that was the idea, we did stick with the idea, we didn't throw it out and start all over again. We did have to figure out what the product was going to look like, etc. We spent nine weeks or so figuring that out. I was on the marketing side, but it was a lot of fun. It was a timely idea. There was some unwarranted optimism at the time. There was going to be action taken on climate change. But unfortunately, climate change was a very boring thing for journalists. But we had a nice hook. They liked to write about us because it was a more consumer-oriented angle that was easy to write a cute story about.\\n \\nWe very quickly found ourselves getting pretty amazing press coverage very disproportion to our size and maturity. That was a great driver of the company.\\n \\n<div id=\\\"self-learn\\\"></div>\\n**Were there any additional classes or resources on campus that really helped you?**\\n \\nNo, I don't think we rely very heavily on other resources. I can imagine doing so if the product itself was more complex, but there wasn't a lot of you know physical design. There wasn't a lot of complicated technology either. Some of the complexity was around sourcing the product. It's quite complicated: understanding the carbon markets. But that was not knowledge that really existed anywhere on campus. It's not like Penn had a department in carbon markets. So that was something we had to develop in-house. It was a fun and intellectually engaging project: carbon markets were new. They combined environmental goals, economic theory and policy in a way that if you happen to be interested in those kinds of topics were lot of fun. So you really just self-taught. I ended up actually doing quite a bit of writing about our markets for general public. That became part of my job description at Terrapass. This was before content management was really a thing. But I guess it was an early form of content management was helping to translate some of these concepts to the general public.\\n\\n**Was there a defining moment that you realized that your idea really had potential?**\\n \\nIt got increasingly interesting after graduation. At that point, it was a very small thing and it was not clear that it could ever be more than a very niche product which arguably is what it actually became. But it was growing in a manner that suggested that there might actually be business there. So no I don't think there was a eureka moment. I think there was steady progress.\\n \\n**Can you talk a bit about the highlights and lowlights of the entire process of Terrapass? What was the partnership process like?**\\n \\nWe did end up landing some big partnerships that really drove growth, certainly the most meaningful one was the partnership with Expedia.\\n \\n**How was that done?**\\n \\n>==It fell into our laps.==\\n\\nThey called. I remember picking up the phone one day and it was them. They were interested in potentially bundling us with airline ticket sales and that came together very quickly. It was successful beyond anything we had imagined. There was the traffic was so disproportionate to anything we've ever seen before and it was a very successful program.\\n \\nThere was also another sort of interesting highlight that quickly became the lowlight was when we were, we became the gift bag for the Academy Awards one year. It was 2006 maybe and they got involved in some controversy because they were giving away overly expensive gift bags to these very wealthy celebrities. And there was some sort of tax implications that they were not properly dealing with and people thought it was somewhat unseemly to shower these wealthy people with high end luxury items. So they decided to do this environmental gestures, which was kind of a fun bizarre project to work on. But also painted a huge bulls-eye from a press standpoint that kicked off some backlash that went into a very critical and also incredibly poorly researched articles that became a big PR disaster for us. So it was a very interesting experience certainly all around, highlight and lowlight.\\n \\n**How did you manage to sell such a premium good to consumers? Was it difficult changing consumer behavior?**\\n \\nAt the end of the day, it was a niche product. We never grow the category to the point where Terrapass was going to be a large business. It appeals to a small self-selected group of people who are engaged on this particular issue. We did a good job of reaching as many of those but it wasn't a large market.\\n \\n<div id=\\\"drivers\\\"></div>\\n**What drove Terrapass?**\\n \\nCertainly early on, it was primarily driven by PR. So that's a nice when you are PR worthy but it doesn't apply in many cases to a lot of companies. Some companies are more masterful than others at generating their own PR. We were early in content marketing. We basically wrote a lot of stuff and syndicated all over the place. We were somewhat geeky policy nerd types and we spent a lot of time getting pretty deep in the woods on these topics and we enjoyed it.\\n \\n**How did you guys deal with environmental regulations?**\\n \\nThis is a complex area because at the time, when we started there were no regulated carbon markets, if I'm remembering correctly. There was only the voluntary markets, but there was clearly a lot of activity around this issue and the thought was that there would soon be regulated carbon markets, hopefully a national one. Certainly there was regular ones in Europe. So the thought was that this would actually happened in America. We ended up seeing was sort of a patchwork of regional ones and we pay a lot of attention because there was this opportunity and risk. We were sort of amassing our own portfolio of these things. And the concern was that their value could basically be really wiped away if the regulations broke in a way that's sort of rendered useless. And certainly there was a lot of private companies who were starting to participate on the voluntary markets on the theory that these things would not be worthless. But this is a lot of kind of reading the tea leaves and paying attention to draft legislation and paying attention to these markets and just trying to stay ahead. But it looks like things might be moving. As it turns out they kind of move nowhere, I mean the national market never came to be. And I actually am just disconnected enough down from this world that I don't know the latest state of the various regional markets are.\\n \\nCertainly, the price never got very high because of the natural gas boom. The caps that were being set were too loose. So there was a lot of slack in the markets. This is probably an overly technical answer to your question. Basically it was a very complex regulatory landscape. And if there's anything I learned at Terrapass, it was to try to avoid that situation.\\n\\n**Did you end up recruiting for a lot of things that MBA students normally recruit for?**\\n \\nNo I didn't apply for any jobs. \\n\\n>==For that recruiting week, I went to Baja Mexico and looked at whales.==\\n\\nIt was probably not the most well considered way to approach my job hunt. But I was not interested in sort of consulting or finance track, so I kind of winged it.\\n \\n**Why is that? What about consulting and finance that didn't attract you?**\\n \\nFinance, looking at it, I wasn't qualified. If it were my dream to go into finance, I could have made that transition at Wharton. But that was not my goal. Consulting, I certainly could jump into. That seemed like a step in the direction away from what I was trying to do, which was find work that really engaged me. Not that I think consulting is necessarily inherently terrible. It seemed like long hours working on project that was probably just work. It wasn't what I was looking for.\\n \\n**Can you talk a bit more about what your MBA meant to you?**\\n \\nWell the truth is I actually went in looking for a career change. I was interested in development economics and went to do an MBA program because I was advised to. It's a terminal degree you get it after two years. It offers a lot of flexibility after that and rather than going to graduate school. That made sense to me, but obviously did not end up going into development economics. I did discover that I enjoy technology, which I do like and enjoy, and there were opportunities to address causes that I cared about, while retaining the flexibility and speed of a startup culture which I generally enjoy.\\n \\n**Could you talk a bit about your relationship with your co-founder Tom? How did you meet him and why did you decide to work with him?**\\n \\nWe knew each other socially at Wharton. And then we also took this class together. Tom was on the sale side for the class. He was very passionate about the project, and I think he had a lot of natural leadership abilities. He's the one who became the chief, while we were still in school for the next quarter. Mostly, he pushed it forward. There was a time where it was a one-man show. There was not really enough of anything to sustain much in the way of operations. When things got more stable, I came back in. I mean we worked well together. We have a very similar set of priorities. And a common view sort of how to build a great company. And at the same time we have a complementing set of operational skills: whereas Tom is very sales and finance driven, and I am very product driven. It's a good partnership because we tend not to conflict on big picture stuff and made meaningful contributions in different areas.\\n \\n**What are you guys working on now?**\\n\\n\\n \\nSo the story now actually grew very directly over our experience at Terrapass. We both wanted to get closer to the energy saving side of thing.\\n \\nCarbon offsets are a financial mechanism and we want to actually get closer the projects themselves. We're both interested in buildings. Buildings use about 40 percent of the world's energy. A lot of the attention goes to transportation. Transportation is certainly sexy. \\n\\n>==Buildings are from the technology standpoint decidedly unsexy. They're pretty old school. They are two tubes of pipes and ducts.==\\n\\nAnd they tend to hang around for decades or even hundreds of years and they're just not on the bleeding edge. And so it seemed like there was an opportunity there. So we were both having thoughts along these lines, without even really having to discuss with one another.\\n \\n**What does Gridium do?**\\n \\n*Editor's Note: After Adam and Tom left Terrapass in 2009, they both went separate ways before coming back together in 2013 to found Gridium.*\\n\\n![](/content/images/2017/04/how_it_works_08.jpg)\\n\\nWe do energy data analytics. We take data from smart meters, new digital upgrade from the old analog meters. That became actionable information for property managers so they can understand and reduce their energy use. Smart meters are fairly new on the scene but basically instead of getting 12 energy data points a year in the form of your monthly bill, people now get 35,000 per year, because smart meters takes reading every 15 minutes. That's both wonderful and also overwhelming to your typical property manager and we saw an opportunity to take a software based approach to energy efficiency. One of the big hurdles of energy efficiency is usually there's an upfront cost and then there's a payback over several years. Even if the payback is there, it is often hard for building operators to bear those upfront costs. We were excited about the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, which when we started Gridium wasn't new but definitely wasn't as dominant as it is now. We saw the possibility of bringing no upfront costs, low ongoing-fee service model to energy efficiency and that's what we did.\\n \\n**Can you describe a typical day for you at the office?**\\n \\nIt's a little different for me. I spend most of my time with engineering team. Even though I'm not an engineer and I don't officially manage them. We have a development lead that is the team with whom I had sort of sitting down day-to-day working together with them on build our product. What I do on a given day, depends a little bit of where we are in our product lifecycle, but we are now releasing all the time. So I'm also doing a little bit of everything. I will be doing product specifications where I'm working with a designer to basically spec out how the product would behave or what the product would look like. I do bunch of customer interviews, where I work with existing users or colleagues to figure out what's working well for them, what's not. I am doing the testing. Certainly, life in a small software startup, mean we don't have a lot of dedicated Quality Assurance resources so often I'm the guy looking at what's being built and making sure it's actually behaving the way that it's supposed to, both in terms of finding bugs and also is it meeting our user requirements. I do a lot of everything else because I'm a founder is therefore I do a lot HR stuff and I chime in on deal strategy and try to figure out, huddle with Tom to make sure we we're not speeding down on our runway too quickly.\\n \\n<div id=\\\"learn\\\"></div>\\n**Any more advice you would give undergraduate or graduates right now?**\\n \\nThere's probably a lot of focus on finding a passion when you're on the ground. For most people, that's probably not the most productive framework for thinking about your career. A lot of us aren't so lucky to necessarily work in a passion field but it's also a reflective understanding of what makes for a good job.\\n \\n>==Essentially all your career you're going to be wanting to look for opportunities to learn as much as possible and the opportunities to exercise skills.==\\n\\nI worry about that sort of thing much more than the exact area in which I applied myself. Not that it's irrelevant or unimportant. In my career, I made a very explicit attempt to seek out areas to focus on that I found meaningful. That being say, there's probably a lot of different areas that I could have ended up. There's sort of happenstance involved, my path is pretty obvious to me.

I actually fell into it unintentionally as I was a Biology major in Stanford. At one point, I thought I was going to go get a Ph.D. in Biology and be a research scientist. It wasn't until towards the end of my senior year that I realize I not want to pursue that path. I should have probably thought harder about it sooner. But when I did take some intro computer science courses my senior year, I ended up enjoying it. So after graduating, I got a job at school working in the Medical Informatics Department, a sort of the bridge into computing. It was a lucky time to make that transition. It was in 1996, Netscape was recently released. Everything was blowing up. Despite the fact that I was kind of under-qualified and clueless, it actually wasn't that hard to get a job.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/medical_info.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>This just goes to show that you can make transitions anytime.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's what took me to Trilogy and gave me a great experience for getting a close up view of basically what a successful startup looks like: both good and bad aspects of that. I certainly had no prior understanding of startups in general, venture, any of these things that college students are probably much more naturally tuned to these days. Even though I went to Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, it wasn't part of my undergraduate experience. It was all very new to me. So after about three years at Trilogy, I went to TellMe which was another hot startup, truly in Silicon Valley not in Texas. I also transition that point from engineering to product management, which I got a feeling was my truer passion.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's Note: Based in Texas, Trilogy is an enterprise software company that automates front office functions. Adam got to work with clients such as Lucent and General Motors.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What got you <em>excited</em> and why did you decide on an MBA?</strong></p>\n<p>I enjoyed aspects of engineering; but what really got me excited was trying to solve problems for people. This involved a more holistic set of skills than coding. It involves talking to users and thinking broadly about the context of what they do day-to-day. There are also elements of interface design. These kind of things that I was most enthusiastic about. So TellMe was an opportunity to transition to product management. I did that for several years and then kind of burnt out. And that's where I was just before Wharton. I actually took over a year off at that point and traveled, a lovely self-indulgent thing to do if you ever have the opportunity to do it right, I say go for it.</p>\n<p><em>Editor's Note: TellMe provides advanced telecom services to Fortune 500 companies, including AT&amp;T, FedEx, and Merrill Lynch.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where did you get a chance to travel?</strong></p>\n<p>I spent six months in South America, so probably two months backpacking in Patagonia. I worked my way up, and spent a while in Ecuador. Then, I came home, applied for an MBA program and as soon as the application process was done, I took off again and spent another roughly six months or so of riding a bicycle across Southeast Asia and China.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/Patagonia.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>You started your first venture in school. Could you give me a quick summary as to what you think Terrapass was when it first started?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Editor's Note: Adam's first venture emerged straight from the Product Design <a href=\"https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1310943\">[OIDD415]</a> class. Professor Ulrich spent the majority of one semester bragging about Terrapass.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/terrapass.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So Karl's class has changed over the years, and ours was the very first version of it. In this version, Karl came up with the basic idea. So that doesn't mean he designed the product or the go-to-market strategy or all of the other things that we have to do. The core of it was carbon offsets for consumers and that was handed to us. So that was the idea, we did stick with the idea, we didn't throw it out and start all over again. We did have to figure out what the product was going to look like, etc. We spent nine weeks or so figuring that out. I was on the marketing side, but it was a lot of fun. It was a timely idea. There was some unwarranted optimism at the time. There was going to be action taken on climate change. But unfortunately, climate change was a very boring thing for journalists. But we had a nice hook. They liked to write about us because it was a more consumer-oriented angle that was easy to write a cute story about.</p>\n<p>We very quickly found ourselves getting pretty amazing press coverage very disproportion to our size and maturity. That was a great driver of the company.</p>\n<div id=\"self-learn\"></div>\n**Were there any additional classes or resources on campus that really helped you?**\n<p>No, I don't think we rely very heavily on other resources. I can imagine doing so if the product itself was more complex, but there wasn't a lot of you know physical design. There wasn't a lot of complicated technology either. Some of the complexity was around sourcing the product. It's quite complicated: understanding the carbon markets. But that was not knowledge that really existed anywhere on campus. It's not like Penn had a department in carbon markets. So that was something we had to develop in-house. It was a fun and intellectually engaging project: carbon markets were new. They combined environmental goals, economic theory and policy in a way that if you happen to be interested in those kinds of topics were lot of fun. So you really just self-taught. I ended up actually doing quite a bit of writing about our markets for general public. That became part of my job description at Terrapass. This was before content management was really a thing. But I guess it was an early form of content management was helping to translate some of these concepts to the general public.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a defining moment that you realized that your idea really had potential?</strong></p>\n<p>It got increasingly interesting after graduation. At that point, it was a very small thing and it was not clear that it could ever be more than a very niche product which arguably is what it actually became. But it was growing in a manner that suggested that there might actually be business there. So no I don't think there was a eureka moment. I think there was steady progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about the highlights and lowlights of the entire process of Terrapass? What was the partnership process like?</strong></p>\n<p>We did end up landing some big partnerships that really drove growth, certainly the most meaningful one was the partnership with Expedia.</p>\n<p><strong>How was that done?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>It fell into our laps.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They called. I remember picking up the phone one day and it was them. They were interested in potentially bundling us with airline ticket sales and that came together very quickly. It was successful beyond anything we had imagined. There was the traffic was so disproportionate to anything we've ever seen before and it was a very successful program.</p>\n<p>There was also another sort of interesting highlight that quickly became the lowlight was when we were, we became the gift bag for the Academy Awards one year. It was 2006 maybe and they got involved in some controversy because they were giving away overly expensive gift bags to these very wealthy celebrities. And there was some sort of tax implications that they were not properly dealing with and people thought it was somewhat unseemly to shower these wealthy people with high end luxury items. So they decided to do this environmental gestures, which was kind of a fun bizarre project to work on. But also painted a huge bulls-eye from a press standpoint that kicked off some backlash that went into a very critical and also incredibly poorly researched articles that became a big PR disaster for us. So it was a very interesting experience certainly all around, highlight and lowlight.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you manage to sell such a premium good to consumers? Was it difficult changing consumer behavior?</strong></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it was a niche product. We never grow the category to the point where Terrapass was going to be a large business. It appeals to a small self-selected group of people who are engaged on this particular issue. We did a good job of reaching as many of those but it wasn't a large market.</p>\n<div id=\"drivers\"></div>\n**What drove Terrapass?**\n<p>Certainly early on, it was primarily driven by PR. So that's a nice when you are PR worthy but it doesn't apply in many cases to a lot of companies. Some companies are more masterful than others at generating their own PR. We were early in content marketing. We basically wrote a lot of stuff and syndicated all over the place. We were somewhat geeky policy nerd types and we spent a lot of time getting pretty deep in the woods on these topics and we enjoyed it.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you guys deal with environmental regulations?</strong></p>\n<p>This is a complex area because at the time, when we started there were no regulated carbon markets, if I'm remembering correctly. There was only the voluntary markets, but there was clearly a lot of activity around this issue and the thought was that there would soon be regulated carbon markets, hopefully a national one. Certainly there was regular ones in Europe. So the thought was that this would actually happened in America. We ended up seeing was sort of a patchwork of regional ones and we pay a lot of attention because there was this opportunity and risk. We were sort of amassing our own portfolio of these things. And the concern was that their value could basically be really wiped away if the regulations broke in a way that's sort of rendered useless. And certainly there was a lot of private companies who were starting to participate on the voluntary markets on the theory that these things would not be worthless. But this is a lot of kind of reading the tea leaves and paying attention to draft legislation and paying attention to these markets and just trying to stay ahead. But it looks like things might be moving. As it turns out they kind of move nowhere, I mean the national market never came to be. And I actually am just disconnected enough down from this world that I don't know the latest state of the various regional markets are.</p>\n<p>Certainly, the price never got very high because of the natural gas boom. The caps that were being set were too loose. So there was a lot of slack in the markets. This is probably an overly technical answer to your question. Basically it was a very complex regulatory landscape. And if there's anything I learned at Terrapass, it was to try to avoid that situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Did you end up recruiting for a lot of things that MBA students normally recruit for?</strong></p>\n<p>No I didn't apply for any jobs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>For that recruiting week, I went to Baja Mexico and looked at whales.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was probably not the most well considered way to approach my job hunt. But I was not interested in sort of consulting or finance track, so I kind of winged it.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is that? What about consulting and finance that didn't attract you?</strong></p>\n<p>Finance, looking at it, I wasn't qualified. If it were my dream to go into finance, I could have made that transition at Wharton. But that was not my goal. Consulting, I certainly could jump into. That seemed like a step in the direction away from what I was trying to do, which was find work that really engaged me. Not that I think consulting is necessarily inherently terrible. It seemed like long hours working on project that was probably just work. It wasn't what I was looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you talk a bit more about what your MBA meant to you?</strong></p>\n<p>Well the truth is I actually went in looking for a career change. I was interested in development economics and went to do an MBA program because I was advised to. It's a terminal degree you get it after two years. It offers a lot of flexibility after that and rather than going to graduate school. That made sense to me, but obviously did not end up going into development economics. I did discover that I enjoy technology, which I do like and enjoy, and there were opportunities to address causes that I cared about, while retaining the flexibility and speed of a startup culture which I generally enjoy.</p>\n<p><strong>Could you talk a bit about your relationship with your co-founder Tom? How did you meet him and why did you decide to work with him?</strong></p>\n<p>We knew each other socially at Wharton. And then we also took this class together. Tom was on the sale side for the class. He was very passionate about the project, and I think he had a lot of natural leadership abilities. He's the one who became the chief, while we were still in school for the next quarter. Mostly, he pushed it forward. There was a time where it was a one-man show. There was not really enough of anything to sustain much in the way of operations. When things got more stable, I came back in. I mean we worked well together. We have a very similar set of priorities. And a common view sort of how to build a great company. And at the same time we have a complementing set of operational skills: whereas Tom is very sales and finance driven, and I am very product driven. It's a good partnership because we tend not to conflict on big picture stuff and made meaningful contributions in different areas.</p>\n<p><strong>What are you guys working on now?</strong></p>\n<p>So the story now actually grew very directly over our experience at Terrapass. We both wanted to get closer to the energy saving side of thing.</p>\n<p>Carbon offsets are a financial mechanism and we want to actually get closer the projects themselves. We're both interested in buildings. Buildings use about 40 percent of the world's energy. A lot of the attention goes to transportation. Transportation is certainly sexy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>Buildings are from the technology standpoint decidedly unsexy. They're pretty old school. They are two tubes of pipes and ducts.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And they tend to hang around for decades or even hundreds of years and they're just not on the bleeding edge. And so it seemed like there was an opportunity there. So we were both having thoughts along these lines, without even really having to discuss with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>What does Gridium do?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Editor's Note: After Adam and Tom left Terrapass in 2009, they both went separate ways before coming back together in 2013 to found Gridium.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/04/how_it_works_08.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We do energy data analytics. We take data from smart meters, new digital upgrade from the old analog meters. That became actionable information for property managers so they can understand and reduce their energy use. Smart meters are fairly new on the scene but basically instead of getting 12 energy data points a year in the form of your monthly bill, people now get 35,000 per year, because smart meters takes reading every 15 minutes. That's both wonderful and also overwhelming to your typical property manager and we saw an opportunity to take a software based approach to energy efficiency. One of the big hurdles of energy efficiency is usually there's an upfront cost and then there's a payback over several years. Even if the payback is there, it is often hard for building operators to bear those upfront costs. We were excited about the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, which when we started Gridium wasn't new but definitely wasn't as dominant as it is now. We saw the possibility of bringing no upfront costs, low ongoing-fee service model to energy efficiency and that's what we did.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you describe a typical day for you at the office?</strong></p>\n<p>It's a little different for me. I spend most of my time with engineering team. Even though I'm not an engineer and I don't officially manage them. We have a development lead that is the team with whom I had sort of sitting down day-to-day working together with them on build our product. What I do on a given day, depends a little bit of where we are in our product lifecycle, but we are now releasing all the time. So I'm also doing a little bit of everything. I will be doing product specifications where I'm working with a designer to basically spec out how the product would behave or what the product would look like. I do bunch of customer interviews, where I work with existing users or colleagues to figure out what's working well for them, what's not. I am doing the testing. Certainly, life in a small software startup, mean we don't have a lot of dedicated Quality Assurance resources so often I'm the guy looking at what's being built and making sure it's actually behaving the way that it's supposed to, both in terms of finding bugs and also is it meeting our user requirements. I do a lot of everything else because I'm a founder is therefore I do a lot HR stuff and I chime in on deal strategy and try to figure out, huddle with Tom to make sure we we're not speeding down on our runway too quickly.</p>\n<div id=\"learn\"></div>\n**Any more advice you would give undergraduate or graduates right now?**\n<p>There's probably a lot of focus on finding a passion when you're on the ground. For most people, that's probably not the most productive framework for thinking about your career. A lot of us aren't so lucky to necessarily work in a passion field but it's also a reflective understanding of what makes for a good job.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>Essentially all your career you're going to be wanting to look for opportunities to learn as much as possible and the opportunities to exercise skills.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I worry about that sort of thing much more than the exact area in which I applied myself. Not that it's irrelevant or unimportant. In my career, I made a very explicit attempt to seek out areas to focus on that I found meaningful. That being say, there's probably a lot of different areas that I could have ended up. There's sort of happenstance involved, my path is pretty obvious to me. Karl assigned us a projects and that's how I ended up really determining much of the course of my post-graduate career. That's dumb luck. So it's more important to figure out what sort of skills you most enjoy exercising and giving yourself a good opportunity to learn from good people and connect with good people around that especially early on.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

Was it difficult\nchanging consumer behavior?\n\nAt the end of the day, it was a niche product. We never grow the category to the\npoint where Terrapass was going to be a large business. It appeals to a small\nself-selected group of people who are engaged on this particular issue. We did a\ngood job of reaching as many of those but it wasn't a large market.\n\n**What drove Terrapass?**Certainly early on, it was primarily driven by PR. So\nthat's a nice when you are PR worthy but it doesn't apply in many cases to a lot\nof companies. Some companies are more masterful than others at generating their\nown PR. We were early in content marketing. We basically wrote a lot of stuff\nand syndicated all over the place. We were somewhat geeky policy nerd types and\nwe spent a lot of time getting pretty deep in the woods on these topics and we\nenjoyed it.\n\nHow did you guys deal with environmental regulations?\n\nThis is a complex area because at the time, when we started there were no\nregulated carbon markets, if I'm remembering correctly. There was only the\nvoluntary markets, but there was clearly a lot of activity around this issue and\nthe thought was that there would soon be regulated carbon markets, hopefully a\nnational one. Certainly there was regular ones in Europe. So the thought was\nthat this would actually happened in America. We ended up seeing was sort of a\npatchwork of regional ones and we pay a lot of attention because there was this\nopportunity and risk. We were sort of amassing our own portfolio of these\nthings. And the concern was that their value could basically be really wiped\naway if the regulations broke in a way that's sort of rendered useless. And\ncertainly there was a lot of private companies who were starting to participate\non the voluntary markets on the theory that these things would not be worthless.\nBut this is a lot of kind of reading the tea leaves and paying attention to\ndraft legislation and paying attention to these markets and just trying to stay\nahead. But it looks like things might be moving. As it turns out they kind of\nmove nowhere, I mean the national market never came to be. And I actually am\njust disconnected enough down from this world that I don't know the latest state\nof the various regional markets are.\n\nCertainly, the price never got very high because of the natural gas boom. The\ncaps that were being set were too loose. So there was a lot of slack in the\nmarkets. This is probably an overly technical answer to your question. Basically\nit was a very complex regulatory landscape. And if there's anything I learned at\nTerrapass, it was to try to avoid that situation.\n\nDid you end up recruiting for a lot of things that MBA students normally recruit\nfor?\n\nNo I didn't apply for any jobs.\n\nFor that recruiting week, I went to Baja Mexico and looked at whales.\n\nIt was probably not the most well considered way to approach my job hunt. But I\nwas not interested in sort of consulting or finance track, so I kind of winged\nit.\n\nWhy is that? What about consulting and finance that didn't attract you?\n\nFinance, looking at it, I wasn't qualified. If it were my dream to go into\nfinance, I could have made that transition at Wharton. But that was not my goal.\nConsulting, I certainly could jump into. That seemed like a step in the\ndirection away from what I was trying to do, which was find work that really\nengaged me. Not that I think consulting is necessarily inherently terrible. It\nseemed like long hours working on project that was probably just work. It wasn't\nwhat I was looking for.\n\nCan you talk a bit more about what your MBA meant to you?\n\nWell the truth is I actually went in looking for a career change. I was\ninterested in development economics and went to do an MBA program because I was\nadvised to. It's a terminal degree you get it after two years. It offers a lot\nof flexibility after that and rather than going to graduate school. That made\nsense to me, but obviously did not end up going into development economics. I\ndid discover that I enjoy technology, which I do like and enjoy, and there were\nopportunities to address causes that I cared about, while retaining the\nflexibility and speed of a startup culture which I generally enjoy.\n\nCould you talk a bit about your relationship with your co-founder Tom? How did\nyou meet him and why did you decide to work with him?\n\nWe knew each other socially at Wharton. And then we also took this class\ntogether. Tom was on the sale side for the class. He was very passionate about\nthe project, and I think he had a lot of natural leadership abilities. He's the\none who became the chief, while we were still in school for the next quarter.\nMostly, he pushed it forward. There was a time where it was a one-man show.\nThere was not really enough of anything to sustain much in the way of\noperations. When things got more stable, I came back in. I mean we worked well\ntogether. We have a very similar set of priorities. And a common view sort of\nhow to build a great company. And at the same time we have a complementing set\nof operational skills: whereas Tom is very sales and finance driven, and I am\nvery product driven. It's a good partnership because we tend not to conflict on\nbig picture stuff and made meaningful contributions in different areas.\n\nWhat are you guys working on now?\n\nSo the story now actually grew very directly over our experience at Terrapass.\nWe both wanted to get closer to the energy saving side of thing.\n\nCarbon offsets are a financial mechanism and we want to actually get closer the\nprojects themselves. We're both interested in buildings. Buildings use about 40\npercent of the world's energy. A lot of the attention goes to transportation.\nTransportation is certainly sexy.\n\nBuildings are from the technology standpoint decidedly unsexy. They're pretty\nold school. They are two tubes of pipes and ducts.\n\nAnd they tend to hang around for decades or even hundreds of years and they're\njust not on the bleeding edge. And so it seemed like there was an opportunity\nthere. So we were both having thoughts along these lines, without even really\nhaving to discuss with one another.\n\nWhat does Gridium do?\n\nEditor's Note: After Adam and Tom left Terrapass in 2009, they both went\nseparate ways before coming back together in 2013 to found Gridium.\n\n\n\nWe do energy data analytics. We take data from smart meters, new digital upgrade\nfrom the old analog meters. That became actionable information for property\nmanagers so they can understand and reduce their energy use. Smart meters are\nfairly new on the scene but basically instead of getting 12 energy data points a\nyear in the form of your monthly bill, people now get 35,000 per year, because\nsmart meters takes reading every 15 minutes. That's both wonderful and also\noverwhelming to your typical property manager and we saw an opportunity to take\na software based approach to energy efficiency. One of the big hurdles of energy\nefficiency is usually there's an upfront cost and then there's a payback over\nseveral years. Even if the payback is there, it is often hard for building\noperators to bear those upfront costs. We were excited about the\nSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, which when we started Gridium wasn't new but\ndefinitely wasn't as dominant as it is now. We saw the possibility of bringing\nno upfront costs, low ongoing-fee service model to energy efficiency and that's\nwhat we did.\n\nCan you describe a typical day for you at the office?\n\nIt's a little different for me. I spend most of my time with engineering team.\nEven though I'm not an engineer and I don't officially manage them. We have a\ndevelopment lead that is the team with whom I had sort of sitting down\nday-to-day working together with them on build our product. What I do on a given\nday, depends a little bit of where we are in our product lifecycle, but we are\nnow releasing all the time. So I'm also doing a little bit of everything. I will\nbe doing product specifications where I'm working with a designer to basically\nspec out how the product would behave or what the product would look like. I do\nbunch of customer interviews, where I work with existing users or colleagues to\nfigure out what's working well for them, what's not. I am doing the testing.\nCertainly, life in a small software startup, mean we don't have a lot of\ndedicated Quality Assurance resources so often I'm the guy looking at what's\nbeing built and making sure it's actually behaving the way that it's supposed\nto, both in terms of finding bugs and also is it meeting our user requirements.\nI do a lot of everything else because I'm a founder is therefore I do a lot HR\nstuff and I chime in on deal strategy and try to figure out, huddle with Tom to\nmake sure we we're not speeding down on our runway too quickly.\n\n**Any more advice you would give undergraduate or graduates right now?**There's\nprobably a lot of focus on finding a passion when you're on the ground. For most\npeople, that's probably not the most productive framework for thinking about\nyour career. A lot of us aren't so lucky to necessarily work in a passion field\nbut it's also a reflective understanding of what makes for a good job.\n\nEssentially all your career you're going to be wanting to look for opportunities\nto learn as much as possible and the opportunities to exercise skills.\n\nI worry about that sort of thing much more than the exact area in which I\napplied myself. Not that it's irrelevant or unimportant. In my career, I made a\nvery explicit attempt to seek out areas to focus on that I found meaningful.\nThat being say, there's probably a lot of different areas that I could have\nended up. There's sort of happenstance involved, my path is pretty obvious to\nme. Karl assigned us a projects and that's how I ended up really determining\nmuch of the course of my post-graduate career. That's dumb luck. So it's more\nimportant to figure out what sort of skills you most enjoy exercising and giving\nyourself a good opportunity to learn from good people and connect with good\npeople around that especially early on.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

In 2008, Slava founded [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/) and since has been putting his 100 percent into growing the international crowdfunding website.

After an engaging hour of discussion and hearing about Slava's hurdles and challenges throughout his career, we could not pass off the chance to interview him ourselves.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What were you like in college?** \\n\\nI tried to have a really well-rounded experience. I was a Wharton undergrad — finance, entrepreneurial management double major. I was a Management 100 TA. I also played football as a freshman and then rugby all four years. I was in a social fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, as a sophomore, and I also helped found a business fraternity chapter at Penn: [AKPsi](http://upennakpsi.org/). I liked hanging out with friends, and I was one of those people who tried to experience a lot of stuff at college. \\n\\n**Being that well rounded, when did you decide to take a leap of faith and really dedicate yourself to one thing or did you really enjoy the well-rounded education that you got?**\\n\\nI was much more into well-roundedness, and having that diverse set of friends and doing lots of different things. I tried not to be too focused on any one thing while I was in college. \\n\\n**How did you balance time and your commitments?** \\n\\nI just kept myself really busy. I wasn't one to spend a lot of time at home in my dorm room. I wasn't one to take lots of nap. I really love the experience of interacting with people going to events. I loved all the socializing and going to all the incredible experiences that happen in college. Plus, being a part of all these communities, whether the professional fraternity, the social fraternity, being a Management 100 TA, or various sports really exposed me to a lot of fun activities. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"stress\\\"></div>\\n**What do you think of college students these days and their approach to either having a well-rounded education or being very focused in a particular area?** \\n\\nI think that college is difficult, especially at Wharton, and it could easily be highly stressful. \\n\\n>==Too often I see young people that stress themselves out too much at too young of an age. It is important to do well in school and get good grades. It's really important to have a well-rounded experience. ==\\n\\n**Now on career type stuff — what did you want to do when you got to Wharton?** \\n\\nI thought I was going to become an investment banker. That's why I applied and got into Wharton. As I started to actually take classes, I decided that I did not want to become an investment banker. I really didn't decide what exactly I wanted to do but I started to sense that I really felt entrepreneurial. \\n\\n\\n>==I like identifying new problems in a world that need solutions. And I just felt like entrepreneurship was the path that I wanted to navigate. ==\\n\\n**Looks like it worked out because you ended up becoming an entrepreneur! What did you think about the Wharton entrepreneurial education overall?** \\n\\nWharton, like many schools, provides a very good curriculum. Being entrepreneurial is much more hands-on, so I can't say much about your classes since I was ready to jump them and become an entrepreneur. Hearing the stories [of entrepreneurial ventures], meeting the entrepreneurs, and learning about the experiences were super valuable as I continued to forward my career, and overall was just very inspirational. \\n\\n**Were there any specific resources that you used over here that you thought were really useful for entrepreneurs. And if not, what do you think Wharton can definitely do better on in their education and resources for entrepreneurs?** \\n\\nBeing a Management 100 TA was helpful because some of the things that I learned were teamwork, leadership, communication, which I think was helpful for entrepreneurship. Coming up with a project that we had to figure out how to run. \\n\\nBeyond that, I took a few entrepreneurial classes — like Ed Shil's class really awesome. He would bring in these super experienced entrepreneurs that would share their stories and you get ask them how they navigate it all. (*Editor's note: Ed Shil is no longer teaching this. [MGMT265: Culture of Technology](https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/index.cfm?gridterm=2016C&gridcourse=MGMT265&griddept=MGMT), taught by Vice Dean Rosenkopf is very similar and currently offered.*) \\n\\nAlso, an OPIM class back in the day was a mixed Wharton and Engineering class where you would come up with a startup and pitch it to VCs at the end of the class (Editor's note: This course is now [EAS445/545: Engineering Entrepreneurship](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/entrepreneurship/eas445-545.php)). These sort of hands-on courses include having to navigate ideas and build up business plans, create mockups or the original web site, what the plans would be, marketing plan, logo, and what the target markets would be. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"repeated\\\"></div>\\n**So pertaining to this very hands-on approach to entrepreneurship, if you were designing an entrepreneurial curriculum for your kids is that the approach you would take?** \\n\\nYeah, if I tried to teach entrepreneurship. I would actually start in seventh grade and do a ten-year program, through high school and college. It would have a dashboard that would track you along the way to see what you're doing well at and what you still need to improve on. And each year, I would do three sections in my class starting in seventh grade. So the first section will be the theory where you learn the material. The second would be your hands-on having to start a company and bring it to market part. And the third section would be learning and reviewing everything: what happened and what went well, what didn't go well, what you can improve on. And I'll do it for ten years in a row so you get practice at bringing the idea to market and the process of probably failing a lot, and learning a lot from this failure.\\n\\n**You said in another interview, one of the best things you can do for the world is to empower entrepreneurs. Where do colleges and universities fit into that in the future?** \\n\\nColleges and universities need to provide the education that is helpful for students to get careers and improve the world, whether that is pre-law, writing, finance or pre-med. I do think that being inspired to become an entrepreneur is super valuable. \\n\\n>==We all think of our entrepreneurs as having very little education, very little practice, that they just jump off a cliff and start companies — taking all the risk in the world. If we strive to provide more guidance to inspire entrepreneurs, we would be in a better place. ==\\n\\n**How do you have the creative confidence to take that kind of leap of faith, to jump off this cliff to start your companies?** \\n\\nI grew up with immigrant parents. We came over from Belarus, so I've seen them work hard and figure out solutions in places where there are massive unknowns. I got inspiration from my parents. I've been raised where anything is possible and that's where the confidence comes from. That doesn't mean that it's easy to have that confidence. Part of that confidence comes from the struggle that comes along when my dad died when I was a kid, and having to figure out life after that. I don't think that everybody needs to go through the same experiences that I have. Some of that can be taught in academic environments and definitely through do a hands-on experiential environment. \\n\\n**Do you remember what you did each summer at Penn?** \\n\\nI did not have a plan, so it was very organic. Between my junior and senior year was the summer that I interned for Cisco Systems, the internet networking company. I interned in Brussels, in Belgium. I did that because I studied abroad and decided to stay in Europe. Between my sophomore and junior year, I interned for West Capital Management, which is an investment management firm that is still around. When I joined them, it was actually only one person, Matthew West. Now, it's dozens of people. I got to see and experience a one-man firm that was really entrepreneurial in management evolve. Between my freshman and sophomore, I just went home.\\n\\n**I want to jump now into more of your story. I think it's really inspirational hearing how you went from getting rejected from 50 plus investors for Indiegogo all the way to running this huge crowd funding site now. When Indiegogo was just getting started, if you had pitched me this idea as a crowd funder I would have thought, \\\"You want me to just throw my money at something on a screen that I've no idea what it's about?\\\" How did you go about getting your first adopters for this?**\\n\\nIt's the classic marketplace challenge. So on the supply side it's the offering company, and on the demand side is the backers and it's a tricky chicken-egg situation trying to keep both sides balanced. We went for the private companies first that tried to used their network to tap into original funding and then tried to use the connections that we got from each of the offering companies where we start getting 10, 50, 100 backers for companies that then created a network of backers for future companies we posted on the site. \\n\\n**How long did it take you to saturate the supply side of products?**\\n\\nSaturated is a major term, so I would say that we are not even saturated now. It definitely took some time to start creating the marketplace effect. A marketplace is one of those things that you can't have it happen overnight. You really do need some time for it to reach liquidity. I would say it took 18 months to have some continuous growth. \\n\\n**During your presentation at Penn, you said, \\\"If you want to change the finance industry, you can't do it in the finance industry\\\". What are some other industries right now that can be changed from the outside? Can you elaborate on that mindset?**\\n\\nHighly regulated industries are very hard to change from the inside because the regulation is set up in a way to have the king stay king, and others won't be able to disrupt them. So anywhere in which there is a lot of regulation will be hard to disrupt the industry. \\n\\n**So as disruptor and kind of a rebel, how do you stay that rebel against the industry and the regulators but also stay congenial enough to get the final result? You were instrumental in the drafting of the JOBS Act (*Editor's note: JOBS act was signed by President Obama in 2012 for new SEC rules on capital formation, including the use of capital in crowd-funding projects*). How do you manage those kinds of relationship dynamics?**\\n\\nThe important thing is to focus on the customer and the products and create something that people want to use. And if you're able stay outside the lens of regulation, then that's great! As you continue to grow, there's a good chance that the regulated industry will interact with you, and you will have to set the dynamic of engagement. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"happy\\\"></div>\\n**What do you think is a fatal mistake that you see a lot of young people making in the context of planning careers and approaching education?** \\n\\nPeople need to be happy. Whether you take a finance job or an entrepreneurial job, or you become a doctor, work is something that you probably spend a lot of time doing. Being able to wake up in the morning feeling passionate and happy about what you're doing all day — now that's a gift. The opposite is you really hate it or you're just doing it for the money or killing time. \\n\\n>==You're really missing out on what incredible things you can accomplish by having the passion behind you as you move forward with your career. ==\\n\\n**Do you have any specific book or movie recommendations?** \\n\\n[12 Angry Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/): The reason is that it shows the power of an individual to believe in his/her passion to improve the world. \\n\\n[Inception](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/): The reason is that it's non-linear. It's not always about the first step, next step, and next step. Sometimes it's about bringing what's in your mind into the reality of the world. In your mind, you've already created the real world, whether those are dreams or day-dreaming or thinking about what the future will be like. In Inception, you need to move from your dream world to the real world. \\n\\n**Jeff Weiner from LinkedIn always champions that everyone should have a one-line life goal.

I would actually start in seventh grade and do a ten-year program, through high school and college. It would have a dashboard that would track you along the way to see what you're doing well at and what you still need to improve on. And each year, I would do three sections in my class starting in seventh grade. So the first section will be the theory where you learn the material. The second would be your hands-on having to start a company and bring it to market part. And the third section would be learning and reviewing everything: what happened and what went well, what didn't go well, what you can improve on. And I'll do it for ten years in a row so you get practice at bringing the idea to market and the process of probably failing a lot, and learning a lot from this failure.</p>\n<p><strong>You said in another interview, one of the best things you can do for the world is to empower entrepreneurs. Where do colleges and universities fit into that in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>Colleges and universities need to provide the education that is helpful for students to get careers and improve the world, whether that is pre-law, writing, finance or pre-med. I do think that being inspired to become an entrepreneur is super valuable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>==We all think of our entrepreneurs as having very little education, very little practice, that they just jump off a cliff and start companies — taking all the risk in the world. If we strive to provide more guidance to inspire entrepreneurs, we would be in a better place. ==</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>How do you have the creative confidence to take that kind of leap of faith, to jump off this cliff to start your companies?</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up with immigrant parents. We came over from Belarus, so I've seen them work hard and figure out solutions in places where there are massive unknowns. I got inspiration from my parents. I've been raised where anything is possible and that's where the confidence comes from. That doesn't mean that it's easy to have that confidence. Part of that confidence comes from the struggle that comes along when my dad died when I was a kid, and having to figure out life after that. I don't think that everybody needs to go through the same experiences that I have. Some of that can be taught in academic environments and definitely through do a hands-on experiential environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you remember what you did each summer at Penn?</strong></p>\n<p>I did not have a plan, so it was very organic. Between my junior and senior year was the summer that I interned for Cisco Systems, the internet networking company. I interned in Brussels, in Belgium. I did that because I studied abroad and decided to stay in Europe. Between my sophomore and junior year, I interned for West Capital Management, which is an investment management firm that is still around. When I joined them, it was actually only one person, Matthew West. Now, it's dozens of people. I got to see and experience a one-man firm that was really entrepreneurial in management evolve. Between my freshman and sophomore, I just went home.</p>\n<p><strong>I want to jump now into more of your story. I think it's really inspirational hearing how you went from getting rejected from 50 plus investors for Indiegogo all the way to running this huge crowd funding site now. When Indiegogo was just getting started, if you had pitched me this idea as a crowd funder I would have thought, &quot;You want me to just throw my money at something on a screen that I've no idea what it's about?&quot; How did you go about getting your first adopters for this?</strong></p>\n<p>It's the classic marketplace challenge. So on the supply side it's the offering company, and on the demand side is the backers and it's a tricky chicken-egg situation trying to keep both sides balanced. We went for the private companies first that tried to used their network to tap into original funding and then tried to use the connections that we got from each of the offering companies where we start getting 10, 50, 100 backers for companies that then created a network of backers for future companies we posted on the site.</p>\n<p><strong>How long did it take you to saturate the supply side of products?</strong></p>\n<p>Saturated is a major term, so I would say that we are not even saturated now. It definitely took some time to start creating the marketplace effect. A marketplace is one of those things that you can't have it happen overnight. You really do need some time for it to reach liquidity. I would say it took 18 months to have some continuous growth.</p>\n<p><strong>During your presentation at Penn, you said, &quot;If you want to change the finance industry, you can't do it in the finance industry&quot;. What are some other industries right now that can be changed from the outside?

After a few years in consulting, Slava took the leap of faith into\nentrepreneurship. In 2008, Slava founded Indiegogo [https://www.indiegogo.com/] \nand since has been putting his 100 percent into growing the international\ncrowdfunding website. To date, the platform has attracted more than $800M \ninvestment for creative, entrepreneurial and cause-related projects launched on\nthe site.\n\nEditor: In mid-February, The Sign.al [http://thesign.al/our-team/]  attended an\nopen talk with Slava and Penn's Engineering Dean Vijay Kumar at the Pennovation\nCenter [https://www.pennovation.upenn.edu/]. After an engaging hour of\ndiscussion and hearing about Slava's hurdles and challenges throughout his\ncareer, we could not pass off the chance to interview him ourselves.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat were you like in college?\n\nI tried to have a really well-rounded experience. I was a Wharton undergrad —\nfinance, entrepreneurial management double major. I was a Management 100 TA. I\nalso played football as a freshman and then rugby all four years. I was in a\nsocial fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, as a sophomore, and I also helped found a\nbusiness fraternity chapter at Penn: AKPsi [http://upennakpsi.org/]. I liked\nhanging out with friends, and I was one of those people who tried to experience\na lot of stuff at college.\n\nBeing that well rounded, when did you decide to take a leap of faith and really\ndedicate yourself to one thing or did you really enjoy the well-rounded\neducation that you got?\n\nI was much more into well-roundedness, and having that diverse set of friends\nand doing lots of different things. I tried not to be too focused on any one\nthing while I was in college.\n\nHow did you balance time and your commitments?\n\nI just kept myself really busy. I wasn't one to spend a lot of time at home in\nmy dorm room. I wasn't one to take lots of nap. I really love the experience of\ninteracting with people going to events. I loved all the socializing and going\nto all the incredible experiences that happen in college. Plus, being a part of\nall these communities, whether the professional fraternity, the social\nfraternity, being a Management 100 TA, or various sports really exposed me to a\nlot of fun activities.\n\n**What do you think of college students these days and their approach to either\nhaving a well-rounded education or being very focused in a particular area?**I\nthink that college is difficult, especially at Wharton, and it could easily be\nhighly stressful.\n\n==Too often I see young people that stress themselves out too much at too young\nof an age. It is important to do well in school and get good grades. It's really\nimportant to have a well-rounded experience. ==\n\nNow on career type stuff — what did you want to do when you got to Wharton?\n\nI thought I was going to become an investment banker. That's why I applied and\ngot into Wharton. As I started to actually take classes, I decided that I did\nnot want to become an investment banker. I really didn't decide what exactly I\nwanted to do but I started to sense that I really felt entrepreneurial.\n\n==I like identifying new problems in a world that need solutions. And I just\nfelt like entrepreneurship was the path that I wanted to navigate. ==\n\nLooks like it worked out because you ended up becoming an entrepreneur! What did\nyou think about the Wharton entrepreneurial education overall?\n\nWharton, like many schools, provides a very good curriculum. Being\nentrepreneurial is much more hands-on, so I can't say much about your classes\nsince I was ready to jump them and become an entrepreneur. Hearing the stories\n[of entrepreneurial ventures], meeting the entrepreneurs, and learning about the\nexperiences were super valuable as I continued to forward my career, and overall\nwas just very inspirational.\n\nWere there any specific resources that you used over here that you thought were\nreally useful for entrepreneurs. And if not, what do you think Wharton can\ndefinitely do better on in their education and resources for entrepreneurs?\n\nBeing a Management 100 TA was helpful because some of the things that I learned\nwere teamwork, leadership, communication, which I think was helpful for\nentrepreneurship. Coming up with a project that we had to figure out how to run.\n\nBeyond that, I took a few entrepreneurial classes — like Ed Shil's class really\nawesome. He would bring in these super experienced entrepreneurs that would\nshare their stories and you get ask them how they navigate it all. (Editor's\nnote: Ed Shil is no longer teaching this.

[10 Hours of Walking in LA as a Woman ... with a dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo)\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Tell us about your undergraduate experience.**\\n\\nSo I actually transferred to Penn my sophomore year. I spent my first year at Middlebury College in Vermont. But it wasn't the right fit for me. I had grown up in a small town, I wanted to break free a little bit, and Middlebury didn't have the diversity that I was looking for. There wasn't a very large lesbian population to be honest with you, nor was there a very large Jewish population and I felt like I didn't fit in. \\n\\n>==It just wasn't the best experience for me. I found myself trying a lot of new things that were very unlike me which was cool, such as playing rugby. But also at the same time there weren’t outlets for the things I really wanted to be doing.==\\n\\n So I transferred to Penn.\\n\\nI had always been a debater in high school. I was the captain of our team and I was the 2009 Washington State Lincoln Douglass Debate champion. Naturally, I thought I was going to be debating at Penn. But then, I met somebody who said, \\\"You're really funny, you should try comedy.\\\" So on a whim, I auditioned for Bloomers, Penn’s all female sketch comedy group. I had a whole lot of fun auditioning, which also ended up becoming my “big time.” I got in and I fell in love with it. It felt like, “Oh wow, this is the missing piece.” \\n\\nMy skill was communicating, so I was naturally great at debate. But when I started doing comedy, I realized that this is was I should be doing.\\n\\n**Were you always funny or did you have to train for the bloomers audition?**\\n\\n>==I think I always had that sense of humor. I think that the thing that I had to learn was how to format my humor in a way other people could find funny, not just off the cuff stuff but things that are performed again and again.==\\n\\n When I first was in Bloomers I wasn't the head writer. My senior year I was the head writer. We all had a lot of input in the direction of the show and we would all submit sketches submit work and work on stuff together. \\n\\nSo in my junior summer before my senior year I interned for the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York. I was in New York and I was seeing as many shows as I could and trying to write as much as possible really with the intention of trying to be a performer and a comedian when I graduated. Also at Penn I wrote for 34th Street Magazine, and senior year I was the editor of the Low Brow section. I also took a comedy writing seminar that is not offered right now but was taught by this amazing guy, Lew Schneider, one of the executive producers and writers of Everybody Loves Raymond. He's really well known in the entertainment industry. \\n\\nNow he is a producer for The Goldbergs. And he had a seminar where he had a few months off from the business, so he would Skype with us and fly in once a month to Penn and we would all meet. \\n\\n**When did the YouTube videos start and when did you decide you were going to try this comedy thing for real?**\\n\\nSo I started doing video stuff when I was 10. I worked on a video trailer with the people who did Classless TV. I don't know if that's still a thing at Penn, but [we did this thing where we can crashed Bid Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G67bwQSdRm0). Everyone was passing out bids and we made up a fake sorority called DTF, Delta Theta Feta, and we had these ridiculous shirts made. Kelly Diamond was the one who came up with this idea. \\n\\nBefore graduation, I was trying to decide between New York and L.A. and I honestly just felt like I didn't really like New York City enough. I felt it was the kind of city where you had to be rich to really feel comfortable. I had friends in L.A. and I'm from Seattle so I wanted to go back to the West Coast. I moved out a couple of weeks after I graduated. And then when I was out here I started doing more sketches.\\n\\n**What gave you the inspiration for these videos: [Sex By Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1ZIVwUKE6M) and [10 Hours of Walking in L.A. as a Woman with a Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo)?**\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ZIVwUKE6M\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nWhen I was a young kid I wrote a lot of songs, like about being a lesbian or coming out of the closet. They were really emotional songs on the ukulele.  And so I had this library of music that wasn't really usable anymore. And I asked, what if these melodies and songs I've written could be turned into jokes? So I started writing comedy songs and I didn’t have videos for all of them but I did them live in comedy for clubs in L.A, and then [Sex By Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo) was one of my favorites. And I thought it'd be really cool to do it visually so that's why I did the puppet video with an audio recording from a live performance and put that up. I got the idea for Sex By Numbers because I was thinking about how silly it was that 69 was named 69 because of the actual shape that people were in, and I was like that's so stupid. \\n\\n>==And so I thought about what other names you could play with if you started on that sex by numbers concept. And so then I started writing out numbers and thinking what do they look like sexually.==\\n\\n I thought 22 looked like you were doubled over in pain, so what if we say it's two people in the fetal position because they have food poisoning? So that was sort of the base idea for that. \\n\\n**And then the [10 Hours of Walking in LA as a Woman With a Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo)?**\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXayJRSHuRo\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nI watched the original [10 Hours of Walking as a Woman in New York](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A) which was exposing catcalling and I realized that's never happened to me in LA. But what does happen to me is whenever I walk my dog people pull their cars over and literally catcall to him. I thought it’d be funny to show how much dogs get called too and at the same time bring more light to the original video. It's really funny if you actually look at some of the comments.\\n\\n**What did you do after Penn?**\\n\\nI was just trying to make as much content as I could. The first job I got was as a producer for a celebrity news television show called OK TV based on OK magazine. I would go to red carpets and I'd be off camera and interview celebrities or I would produce segments and then I would actually edit the segments together for the show. I was totally out of my element, I'd never done anything like that before, but I learned fast and it was something I enjoyed. Then I got offered a job through my friend Caroline Yost, who was a Bloomer. She was working as a production assistant on Mozart in the Jungle and they needed a new one because Carolyn had to leave. They only needed me for a couple months, but I knew the opportunity was in scripted TV, which was what I wanted to be moving toward anyway. I left my job to do it and then after a couple months they were pretty much done, the writers’ room had disbanded, and so I started working one on one with some of the writers a little bit, helping them out with pitch documents or editing. I felt like for the first time I was doing more writer’s assistant-y stuff which is what everybody who wants to be a writer wants to to first. That's different from a writer’s production assistant who sort of gets you coffee which is what my job was in Mozart in the Jungle. The writer’s assistant is sort of an assistant writer, they help keep track of everything. So I started doing sort of freelance writer’s assistant work for some of the writers on the show. I was Luke Wilson's personal assistant for ten seconds, that was fun.\\n\\nBut then I left that job to work as the story and editorial production assistant on the Scooby Doo movie at Warner Brothers. \\n\\nSo that's what I was doing before I left the entertainment industry. \\n\\n\\n**Where does Fresh Prints come in?**\\n\\nThis whole time I was also working as an artist for Fresh Prints, and even since my since my senior year at Penn. A friend at Penn was friends with the guy who started Fresh Prints. I got hired to work freelance as one of the designers. And then I did that up until up until I started working with them full time, and now it has been four amazing years.\\n\\n*[Fresh Prints](https://freshprints.com/product/gallery) is where you want to go for custom apparel. There are local sales managers that make sure your order experience is top notch and they deliver the best artwork for Student Groups, Greek Organizations, University Administrations, and Intramural Teams thanks to Lizzie's hard work*\\n\\n**And how long have you been illustrating.**\\n\\nMy whole life. I was always obsessed with drawing. When I was a kid, at recess I'd be in the library drawing instead of outside playing. And I just loved it. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"monetize\\\"></div>\\n\\n**And what spurred the full time commitment to Fresh Prints**\\n\\nI had a bit of a complicated moment. I always thought that the key to being happy in your job, was taking something that you love doing for free, and make money doing it. I loved comedy and writing and performing and coming up with funny ideas. And so I thought that if I could find a way to make money doing that or in that realm that I would be happy. \\n\\nBut that was a misconception. \\n\\nI realized that there were parts of the entertainment industry that I really didn't like: the way people treated each other, the way that the product is viewed as more important than the people who are making the product, the way that money is prioritized above everything, and the way there's a lot of instability. \\n\\nAnd I decided that, at that time, I thought I wanted to be a rabbi because I had always been interested in Judaism and I felt like there wasn't any soul in the business. And so I wanted to go as far from that as possible to something that had a lot of soul in it which is like being a rabbi. So my idea was I'll quit and I'll work for Fresh Prints and then after a couple of years I'll go to school to be a rabbi. \\n\\nI'm still very religious and spiritual. I'm actually planning on writing a musical about a famous Jewish figure with a fellow Penn alum. So I still want to write and create things. I just needed to take some time off because I realized I loved  performing but when I started performing every single night the same shit over and over again, it became a job. And so I realized it's not about doing what you like. No matter how much you love it there's going to be a day where you don't want to do it. There's going to be a time when you don't want to get out of bed and get up and do it. And at that point it becomes a job. And so it's not something you like anymore. \\n\\n>==And it's probably something you take for granted but I felt it had been PUMPED into me: \\\"Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life, find something you love.\\\" And what I realized was that it's not about having a job where you do something you love, it's about having a job that you love.==\\n\\nAnd so there are things about my job now that I love so much like working with amazing people, creating something that actually gets produced and made, getting to create art all day, getting to work from home and having that flexibility. \\n\\nThat type of environment I love. And so I love my job. \\n\\nSo a big thing I think I realized career-wise was that you kind of get told to take something you love and monetize it. But I don't think that that's necessarily a recipe for happiness. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"shit\\\"></div>\\n\\n**Do you want to go back to the entertainment industry?**\\n\\nIt's not that I want to go back into the industry. It's that I want to create stuff again. So I don't want to go work as an assistant again, ever. I don't want to go work on some production that I'm not invested in, ever. I love my job. But it is important to me to write and create and it is not the case that you need to be an assistant in order to get somebody to read your shit. And if your shit is good, that's all that matters. I'm just removing myself from the hustle, and I'm going to create and work on stuff because I want to do creative work and if people are into it they're into it. It's not a money making thing for me. \\n\\n**What did you do each of your summers at Penn?**\\n\\nSummer before I came to Penn I did nothing, I went home and just did nothing the summer between my sophomore and junior year. I studied PPE, so the summer before my sophomore and junior year. I worked for the Decision Education Foundation which was an internship program to help devise a program to help teach concepts from decision theory to fifth and sixth graders. I also worked as a researcher for the School of Public Policy for Dr. Susan Sorenson, who is an incredible person and academic who's still a Penn. At one point I interviewed for an internship at The Daily Show. But I fucked it up so I didn't get it. They saw my resume and thought I wanted to be a lawyer. And soon as I started talking about wanting to be a comedian, they were like, “No.” \\n\\n**So at the end of the day what would you consider yourself an illustrator a comedian or a storyteller?**\\n\\nOnly time will tell what the narrative connecting everything is in my life. But I think the biggest thing is just creating things and trying to bring that into everything I do in my life. It's kind of been a blessing and a curse for me, I have a lot of interest which is cool but it's also hard. It's not like there is one thing I can devote my whole life to. \\n\\nThat said, Fresh Prints is a huge part of my life. We're doing real cool stuff and growing really really fast.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"penn\\\"></div>\\n\\n**What is something you're definitely going to do in the future?**\\n\\nThe play I’m writing is religious. It's going to be more dark humor. I'm working on it with my friend Sam Pasternack, who's also a Penn alum. \\n\\n>==I think the biggest theme of what I've been saying is all these names are all people who went to Penn and we're all still friends who have a common goal. I think just keeping in touch with the people from Penn and creating with them is so important.==\\n\\nYou really never know when you're going to need to know a composer or when you're going to need a designer. Right now I'm helping my friend design a thing for a flyer for my friend's play that’s going to be in a Fringe festival in Edinburgh. The cool thing about Penn is you're surrounded by people who are similarly driven and who similarly have stories to tell and the creatives all help each other out. It's cool. \\n\\n**Tell me more about Fresh Prints.**\\n\\nOur goal is to help student entrepreneurs grow businesses on their campuses. Three of the four execs right now, not including me, started their own businesses and sold them before they were 20. So they want to help give similar opportunities to kids. \\n\\n>==We want to help kids grow their own businesses. So we print custom apparel T-shirts growing really quickly. Our best campus manager did over 200,000 dollars last semester in sales. ==\\n\\nIt's an amazing experience to actually talk to all these college students and work with them. We have a team of artists, both student artists who work freelance and employees who are overseas, who I work with really closely and we can create custom art for whatever you need from the ground up. So that's my side of it, everything creative. And we get to grow really fast and be part of a really exciting business.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

I spent my first year at Middlebury College in Vermont. But it wasn't the right fit for me. I had grown up in a small town, I wanted to break free a little bit, and Middlebury didn't have the diversity that I was looking for. There wasn't a very large lesbian population to be honest with you, nor was there a very large Jewish population and I felt like I didn't fit in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>It just wasn't the best experience for me. I found myself trying a lot of new things that were very unlike me which was cool, such as playing rugby. But also at the same time there weren’t outlets for the things I really wanted to be doing.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I transferred to Penn.</p>\n<p>I had always been a debater in high school. I was the captain of our team and I was the 2009 Washington State Lincoln Douglass Debate champion. Naturally, I thought I was going to be debating at Penn. But then, I met somebody who said, &quot;You're really funny, you should try comedy.&quot; So on a whim, I auditioned for Bloomers, Penn’s all female sketch comedy group. I had a whole lot of fun auditioning, which also ended up becoming my “big time.” I got in and I fell in love with it. It felt like, “Oh wow, this is the missing piece.”</p>\n<p>My skill was communicating, so I was naturally great at debate. But when I started doing comedy, I realized that this is was I should be doing.</p>\n<p><strong>Were you always funny or did you have to train for the bloomers audition?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>I think I always had that sense of humor. I think that the thing that I had to learn was how to format my humor in a way other people could find funny, not just off the cuff stuff but things that are performed again and again.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I first was in Bloomers I wasn't the head writer. My senior year I was the head writer. We all had a lot of input in the direction of the show and we would all submit sketches submit work and work on stuff together.</p>\n<p>So in my junior summer before my senior year I interned for the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York. I was in New York and I was seeing as many shows as I could and trying to write as much as possible really with the intention of trying to be a performer and a comedian when I graduated. Also at Penn I wrote for 34th Street Magazine, and senior year I was the editor of the Low Brow section. I also took a comedy writing seminar that is not offered right now but was taught by this amazing guy, Lew Schneider, one of the executive producers and writers of Everybody Loves Raymond. He's really well known in the entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>Now he is a producer for The Goldbergs. And he had a seminar where he had a few months off from the business, so he would Skype with us and fly in once a month to Penn and we would all meet.</p>\n<p><strong>When did the YouTube videos start and when did you decide you were going to try this comedy thing for real?</strong></p>\n<p>So I started doing video stuff when I was 10. I worked on a video trailer with the people who did Classless TV. I don't know if that's still a thing at Penn, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G67bwQSdRm0\">we did this thing where we can crashed Bid Day</a>. Everyone was passing out bids and we made up a fake sorority called DTF, Delta Theta Feta, and we had these ridiculous shirts made. Kelly Diamond was the one who came up with this idea.</p>\n<p>Before graduation, I was trying to decide between New York and L.A. and I honestly just felt like I didn't really like New York City enough. I felt it was the kind of city where you had to be rich to really feel comfortable. I had friends in L.A. and I'm from Seattle so I wanted to go back to the West Coast. I moved out a couple of weeks after I graduated. And then when I was out here I started doing more sketches.</p>\n<p><strong>What gave you the inspiration for these videos: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1ZIVwUKE6M\">Sex By Numbers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo\">10 Hours of Walking in L.A. as a Woman with a Dog</a>?</strong></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1ZIVwUKE6M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>When I was a young kid I wrote a lot of songs, like about being a lesbian or coming out of the closet. They were really emotional songs on the ukulele.  And so I had this library of music that wasn't really usable anymore. And I asked, what if these melodies and songs I've written could be turned into jokes? So I started writing comedy songs and I didn’t have videos for all of them but I did them live in comedy for clubs in L.A, and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo\">Sex By Numbers</a> was one of my favorites. And I thought it'd be really cool to do it visually so that's why I did the puppet video with an audio recording from a live performance and put that up. I got the idea for Sex By Numbers because I was thinking about how silly it was that 69 was named 69 because of the actual shape that people were in, and I was like that's so stupid.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>And so I thought about what other names you could play with if you started on that sex by numbers concept.

I spent my first year at\nMiddlebury College in Vermont. But it wasn't the right fit for me. I had grown\nup in a small town, I wanted to break free a little bit, and Middlebury didn't\nhave the diversity that I was looking for. There wasn't a very large lesbian\npopulation to be honest with you, nor was there a very large Jewish population\nand I felt like I didn't fit in.\n\nIt just wasn't the best experience for me. I found myself trying a lot of new\nthings that were very unlike me which was cool, such as playing rugby. But also\nat the same time there weren’t outlets for the things I really wanted to be\ndoing.\n\nSo I transferred to Penn.\n\nI had always been a debater in high school. I was the captain of our team and I\nwas the 2009 Washington State Lincoln Douglass Debate champion. Naturally, I\nthought I was going to be debating at Penn. But then, I met somebody who said,\n\"You're really funny, you should try comedy.\" So on a whim, I auditioned for\nBloomers, Penn’s all female sketch comedy group. I had a whole lot of fun\nauditioning, which also ended up becoming my “big time.” I got in and I fell in\nlove with it. It felt like, “Oh wow, this is the missing piece.”\n\nMy skill was communicating, so I was naturally great at debate. But when I\nstarted doing comedy, I realized that this is was I should be doing.\n\nWere you always funny or did you have to train for the bloomers audition?\n\nI think I always had that sense of humor. I think that the thing that I had to\nlearn was how to format my humor in a way other people could find funny, not\njust off the cuff stuff but things that are performed again and again.\n\nWhen I first was in Bloomers I wasn't the head writer. My senior year I was the\nhead writer. We all had a lot of input in the direction of the show and we would\nall submit sketches submit work and work on stuff together.\n\nSo in my junior summer before my senior year I interned for the Upright Citizens\nBrigade Theater in New York. I was in New York and I was seeing as many shows as\nI could and trying to write as much as possible really with the intention of\ntrying to be a performer and a comedian when I graduated. Also at Penn I wrote\nfor 34th Street Magazine, and senior year I was the editor of the Low Brow\nsection. I also took a comedy writing seminar that is not offered right now but\nwas taught by this amazing guy, Lew Schneider, one of the executive producers\nand writers of Everybody Loves Raymond. He's really well known in the\nentertainment industry.\n\nNow he is a producer for The Goldbergs. And he had a seminar where he had a few\nmonths off from the business, so he would Skype with us and fly in once a month\nto Penn and we would all meet.\n\nWhen did the YouTube videos start and when did you decide you were going to try\nthis comedy thing for real?\n\nSo I started doing video stuff when I was 10. I worked on a video trailer with\nthe people who did Classless TV. I don't know if that's still a thing at Penn,\nbut we did this thing where we can crashed Bid Day\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G67bwQSdRm0]. Everyone was passing out bids and\nwe made up a fake sorority called DTF, Delta Theta Feta, and we had these\nridiculous shirts made. Kelly Diamond was the one who came up with this idea.\n\nBefore graduation, I was trying to decide between New York and L.A. and I\nhonestly just felt like I didn't really like New York City enough. I felt it was\nthe kind of city where you had to be rich to really feel comfortable. I had\nfriends in L.A. and I'm from Seattle so I wanted to go back to the West Coast. I\nmoved out a couple of weeks after I graduated. And then when I was out here I\nstarted doing more sketches.\n\nWhat gave you the inspiration for these videos: Sex By Numbers\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1ZIVwUKE6M]  and 10 Hours of Walking in L.A.\nas a Woman with a Dog [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo]?\n\nWhen I was a young kid I wrote a lot of songs, like about being a lesbian or\ncoming out of the closet. They were really emotional songs on the ukulele. And\nso I had this library of music that wasn't really usable anymore. And I asked,\nwhat if these melodies and songs I've written could be turned into jokes? So I\nstarted writing comedy songs and I didn’t have videos for all of them but I did\nthem live in comedy for clubs in L.A, and then Sex By Numbers\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo]  was one of my favorites. And I\nthought it'd be really cool to do it visually so that's why I did the puppet\nvideo with an audio recording from a live performance and put that up. I got the\nidea for Sex By Numbers because I was thinking about how silly it was that 69\nwas named 69 because of the actual shape that people were in, and I was like\nthat's so stupid.\n\nAnd so I thought about what other names you could play with if you started on\nthat sex by numbers concept. And so then I started writing out numbers and\nthinking what do they look like sexually.\n\nI thought 22 looked like you were doubled over in pain, so what if we say it's\ntwo people in the fetal position because they have food poisoning? So that was\nsort of the base idea for that.\n\nAnd then the 10 Hours of Walking in LA as a Woman With a Dog\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXayJRSHuRo]?\n\nI watched the original 10 Hours of Walking as a Woman in New York\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A]  which was exposing catcalling and\nI realized that's never happened to me in LA. But what does happen to me is\nwhenever I walk my dog people pull their cars over and literally catcall to him.\nI thought it’d be funny to show how much dogs get called too and at the same\ntime bring more light to the original video. It's really funny if you actually\nlook at some of the comments.\n\nWhat did you do after Penn?\n\nI was just trying to make as much content as I could. The first job I got was as\na producer for a celebrity news television show called OK TV based on OK\nmagazine. I would go to red carpets and I'd be off camera and interview\ncelebrities or I would produce segments and then I would actually edit the\nsegments together for the show. I was totally out of my element, I'd never done\nanything like that before, but I learned fast and it was something I enjoyed.\nThen I got offered a job through my friend Caroline Yost, who was a Bloomer. She\nwas working as a production assistant on Mozart in the Jungle and they needed a\nnew one because Carolyn had to leave. They only needed me for a couple months,\nbut I knew the opportunity was in scripted TV, which was what I wanted to be\nmoving toward anyway. I left my job to do it and then after a couple months they\nwere pretty much done, the writers’ room had disbanded, and so I started working\none on one with some of the writers a little bit, helping them out with pitch\ndocuments or editing. I felt like for the first time I was doing more writer’s\nassistant-y stuff which is what everybody who wants to be a writer wants to to\nfirst. That's different from a writer’s production assistant who sort of gets\nyou coffee which is what my job was in Mozart in the Jungle. The writer’s\nassistant is sort of an assistant writer, they help keep track of everything. So\nI started doing sort of freelance writer’s assistant work for some of the\nwriters on the show. I was Luke Wilson's personal assistant for ten seconds,\nthat was fun.\n\nBut then I left that job to work as the story and editorial production assistant\non the Scooby Doo movie at Warner Brothers.\n\nSo that's what I was doing before I left the entertainment industry.\n\nWhere does Fresh Prints come in?\n\nThis whole time I was also working as an artist for Fresh Prints, and even since\nmy since my senior year at Penn. A friend at Penn was friends with the guy who\nstarted Fresh Prints. I got hired to work freelance as one of the designers. And\nthen I did that up until up until I started working with them full time, and now\nit has been four amazing years.\n\nFresh Prints [https://freshprints.com/product/gallery]  is where you want to go\nfor custom apparel. There are local sales managers that make sure your order\nexperience is top notch and they deliver the best artwork for Student Groups,\nGreek Organizations, University Administrations, and Intramural Teams thanks to\nLizzie's hard work\n\nAnd how long have you been illustrating.\n\nMy whole life. I was always obsessed with drawing. When I was a kid, at recess\nI'd be in the library drawing instead of outside playing. And I just loved it.\n\nAnd what spurred the full time commitment to Fresh Prints\n\nI had a bit of a complicated moment. I always thought that the key to being\nhappy in your job, was taking something that you love doing for free, and make\nmoney doing it. I loved comedy and writing and performing and coming up with\nfunny ideas. And so I thought that if I could find a way to make money doing\nthat or in that realm that I would be happy.\n\nBut that was a misconception.\n\nI realized that there were parts of the entertainment industry that I really\ndidn't like: the way people treated each other, the way that the product is\nviewed as more important than the people who are making the product, the way\nthat money is prioritized above everything, and the way there's a lot of\ninstability.\n\nAnd I decided that, at that time, I thought I wanted to be a rabbi because I had\nalways been interested in Judaism and I felt like there wasn't any soul in the\nbusiness. And so I wanted to go as far from that as possible to something that\nhad a lot of soul in it which is like being a rabbi. So my idea was I'll quit\nand I'll work for Fresh Prints and then after a couple of years I'll go to\nschool to be a rabbi.\n\nI'm still very religious and spiritual. I'm actually planning on writing a\nmusical about a famous Jewish figure with a fellow Penn alum. So I still want to\nwrite and create things. I just needed to take some time off because I realized\nI loved performing but when I started performing every single night the same\nshit over and over again, it became a job. And so I realized it's not about\ndoing what you like. No matter how much you love it there's going to be a day\nwhere you don't want to do it. There's going to be a time when you don't want to\nget out of bed and get up and do it. And at that point it becomes a job. And so\nit's not something you like anymore.\n\nAnd it's probably something you take for granted but I felt it had been PUMPED\ninto me: \"Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life, find\nsomething you love.\" And what I realized was that it's not about having a job\nwhere you do something you love, it's about having a job that you love.\n\nAnd so there are things about my job now that I love so much like working with\namazing people, creating something that actually gets produced and made, getting\nto create art all day, getting to work from home and having that flexibility.\n\nThat type of environment I love. And so I love my job.\n\nSo a big thing I think I realized career-wise was that you kind of get told to\ntake something you love and monetize it. But I don't think that that's\nnecessarily a recipe for happiness.\n\nDo you want to go back to the entertainment industry?\n\nIt's not that I want to go back into the industry. It's that I want to create\nstuff again. So I don't want to go work as an assistant again, ever. I don't\nwant to go work on some production that I'm not invested in, ever. I love my\njob. But it is important to me to write and create and it is not the case that\nyou need to be an assistant in order to get somebody to read your shit. And if\nyour shit is good, that's all that matters. I'm just removing myself from the\nhustle, and I'm going to create and work on stuff because I want to do creative\nwork and if people are into it they're into it. It's not a money making thing\nfor me.\n\nWhat did you do each of your summers at Penn?\n\nSummer before I came to Penn I did nothing, I went home and just did nothing the\nsummer between my sophomore and junior year. I studied PPE, so the summer before\nmy sophomore and junior year. I worked for the Decision Education Foundation\nwhich was an internship program to help devise a program to help teach concepts\nfrom decision theory to fifth and sixth graders. I also worked as a researcher\nfor the School of Public Policy for Dr. Susan Sorenson, who is an incredible\nperson and academic who's still a Penn. At one point I interviewed for an\ninternship at The Daily Show. But I fucked it up so I didn't get it. They saw my\nresume and thought I wanted to be a lawyer. And soon as I started talking about\nwanting to be a comedian, they were like, “No.”\n\nSo at the end of the day what would you consider yourself an illustrator a\ncomedian or a storyteller?\n\nOnly time will tell what the narrative connecting everything is in my life. But\nI think the biggest thing is just creating things and trying to bring that into\neverything I do in my life. It's kind of been a blessing and a curse for me, I\nhave a lot of interest which is cool but it's also hard. It's not like there is\none thing I can devote my whole life to.\n\nThat said, Fresh Prints is a huge part of my life. We're doing real cool stuff\nand growing really really fast.\n\nWhat is something you're definitely going to do in the future?\n\nThe play I’m writing is religious. It's going to be more dark humor. I'm working\non it with my friend Sam Pasternack, who's also a Penn alum.\n\nI think the biggest theme of what I've been saying is all these names are all\npeople who went to Penn and we're all still friends who have a common goal. I\nthink just keeping in touch with the people from Penn and creating with them is\nso important.\n\nYou really never know when you're going to need to know a composer or when\nyou're going to need a designer. Right now I'm helping my friend design a thing\nfor a flyer for my friend's play that’s going to be in a Fringe festival in\nEdinburgh. The cool thing about Penn is you're surrounded by people who are\nsimilarly driven and who similarly have stories to tell and the creatives all\nhelp each other out. It's cool.\n\nTell me more about Fresh Prints.\n\nOur goal is to help student entrepreneurs grow businesses on their campuses.\nThree of the four execs right now, not including me, started their own\nbusinesses and sold them before they were 20. So they want to help give similar\nopportunities to kids.\n\n==We want to help kids grow their own businesses. So we print custom apparel\nT-shirts growing really quickly. Our best campus manager did over 200,000\ndollars last semester in sales. ==\n\nIt's an amazing experience to actually talk to all these college students and\nwork with them. We have a team of artists, both student artists who work\nfreelance and employees who are overseas, who I work with really closely and we\ncan create custom art for whatever you need from the ground up. So that's my\nside of it, everything creative. And we get to grow really fast and be part of a\nreally exciting business.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

It's important to separate the grades from the social issues and personal growth.](http://thesign.al/ruchi-thiru-on-using-data-for-education-reform/#education-reform)\\n ------\\nRuchi graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 2006 with a BS in Economics concentrating in Marketing and Management and from the Northwestern University Kellogg School of Business in 2011 with a MBA in Social Enterprise, Management, and Marketing. She is now the Managing Director of Operations & Information at KIPP Bay Area Schools.\\n\\n*Editor: Education reform always resonated with me as one of the most impactful issues to rally behind. However, outside of going into teaching or politics, I wasn't sure how else to get involved. Ruchi really put into perspective how college students can use their skills to make a social change.*\\n ------\\n**So you went from consulting to the Clorox Company to data in education — wow. To start off can you give us a quick preface of your interesting career journey.**\\n\\nI started off doing marketing consulting. Marketing is an area that people often treated as very fuzzy, but I knew that there was a very analytical side of it, and wanted to learn it. After a few years in New York City, I went back for my MBA at Kellogg to move into brand management.\\n\\nWhen I decided to make a career switch, I had a family situation. I lost my father, and it made me take a step back from my career and really think about what I wanted to do. During that time I realized that I spent a lot of personal time volunteering in the education space, but I had never thought about it as a career before. So I just decided to jump in and see how I could contribute.\\n\\nMy first role in education was on the data team for a network of charter schools called KIPP. Now I oversee the operations, tech, and data departments here. \\n\\n**It’s quite a shift to jump from private sector into public sector. Did you use any resources to help you make that transition?**\\n\\nI joined the [Broad Residency](http://www.broadcenter.org/residency/), which is a project funded by billionaire Eli Broad. They find people at higher levels of talent in the private sector and get them to switch to the education industry. Through this, I got a master's degree in Education Leadership. It was a rigorous program but worth it — it helped me make connections with different school districts and charter organizations that if I had applied to right off the bat, they likely would not have understood my previous private industry experience. There's also a program called [Education Pioneers](http://www.educationpioneers.org/) that takes in people of all levels.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"too-many-unknowns\\\"></div>\\n**What's the most challenging analytics project you've done so far?**\\n\\nEverything is really challenging. It’s not like university research in which you have thousands of students that you're running regressions off of. Right now in education, there's a big trend around blended learning through the use of technology in schools and programs like Khan Academy. *(Editor's note: Blended education is a style of teaching that combines online video instruction with instructor-led practices)*\\n\\nWe're always trying to understand if that has a positive impact on our students’ education. But, I think the lesson learned is exactly as you stated — there are so many things going on with individual students that it's hard to come up with broad generalizations. It's not as simple as this group of kids used the program and this other group didn't. In reality, they have different teachers, they might have used the program differently for a different amount of time, or they might have started at a different level than another class. So there are just so many factors that it's really hard to understand the benefit of some of these programs when they're used so differently. \\n\\nOne of the things I’ve learned from that is not to get too caught up in needing statistically significant regression analyses all the time. Oftentimes, you can get quick directional learning that is enough to make you feel confident to make a decision without getting everything perfect. \\n>==*It's like that mantra that “perfect can be the enemy of good”, and it can get in your way if you try to do something to the T.*==\\n\\n<div id=\\\"education-reform\\\"></div>\\n**What are some metrics you have to see how successful KIPP is being in engaging the students, outside of just traditional test scores and performance?**\\n\\nFirst of all, we try to get teachers who look like our students because they can connect better. There is a difference when you're a young black boy and you have a black male teacher. We want them to have role models and see the world of possibilities and professions there are for them.\\n\\nBeyond that, we think a lot about being what we call “culturally competent”. Kids know when you genuinely care about them. A lot of our focus of being culturally responsive is to not use the textbooks that are written by the winners. \\n\\n>==*In the U.S., a lot of the winners are white, so we try to have a lot of different texts in the classroom written by authors that are Latino, African American, Native American, or Asian American — just all different backgrounds.*==\\n\\nWe want to compare other narratives and perspectives with every moment in history we’re teaching about. The core thing is building relationships and recognizing that education should reflect and celebrate their background as well. \\n\\n**How much of a role does KIPP try to play in tackling social issues these kids face that interfere with their education (e.g. poverty, racial discrimination, parental incarceration)?**\\n\\nOne of the biggest things we do is focusing as equally on culture and character-building as we do on academics. Ninety percent scores on a state test doesn’t necessarily mean students will automatically thrive if they went to a school like Penn. We build their character up to help them succeed anywhere, focusing on curiosity, social intelligence, self-control, and independent thinking.\\n\\nCulture is a big part of our school because of the unstable home conditions that many students may come from. We have a lot of school support, including psychologists and mental health professionals. We try to focus on restorative practices, emotional learning, and anything to keep students involved in school instead of outside. If a student misbehaves, instead of suspending them, we keep them in the school community and teach them why their behavior is wrong, how to respond to conflicts in a non-physical way, and ways to solve them. School is a safe-haven for these students. We train our teachers on classroom management and how to deal with these types of issues. There’s a lot going on in these students’ lives and we need to give them an outlet here.\\n\\n**Do you have a certain memory or anything that you keep to motivate yourself every day to keep striving in this role?**\\n\\nI think of my dad a lot. When my dad passed away from cancer, I reflected on my career and committed to making this change. We are an immigrant family and he worked so hard to get me access to the education that I had. My parents instilled the value of education in me forever. In my household, it was *when* you go to college, not *if* you go to college. Growing up, I never realized that could be different from other families and took it for granted. I think of him and tell my story often because it's important for other people to know why I’m committed to this work. \\n>==*Even though I haven't been much of a teacher myself, I chose this very consciously and believe in it because education has leveled the playing field for my family firsthand.*==\\n\\n**I'm sorry to hear that. It's great that you were able to turn it into such strong motivation. What do you try to work on now to advance the future of education?**\\n\\nTechnology's got to be a critical part of education because it's a critical part of our everyday lives. A lot of our students don't have access to computers in their home. If we didn't have Chromebooks in our classroom, then we would be missing out on the opportunity to give our kids exposure to what they may see every day at work. \\n\\nOne part will be universal basic access to technology in a classroom. Then the second part is using that technology to provide good teaching content. Our teachers are absolutely incredible, and they work so hard. To have access to materials that could make their job a little bit more sustainable, so that they're not always creating lesson plans from scratch is a big deal. \\n\\nPart of this comes with the rise of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). The idea that people all around the world can have access to quality education is great. I hope that we leverage it more.\\n\\n**It’s interesting you mention MOOCs. Some people love that they can replace formalized education and allow anyone to gain skills on their own. But one big issue they're running into is the low retention rate, low engagement rate, and accountability problem.**\\n\\nCan I add to that? I think MOOCs have a different goal. MOOCs want more access. They're breaking that barrier to access and giving a broad range of people access to content they wouldn't have access to otherwise. It is achieving that, but like you said, there's a major retention problem. \\n\\nWhen we're talking elementary, middle, and high school, we're talking about the core content of public education. So the goal isn't just access. It’s to actually master the content. If you just leave them on their own with the material, you don't have that interplay to really understand if they're mastering the content. It's more of how do we layer this with the teacher to give people different ways to interact with the material and master the different skills that we're trying to teach. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"make-an-impact\\\"></div>\\n**Shifting to the careers side, what do you suggest students interested in working in education do to prepare?** \\n\\nThey should get exposure to what the classroom looks like and getting in front of kids, whether it's through a volunteer assignment or student teaching. By getting in front of kids regularly, you can understand if that's what motivates you. I taught English just one summer abroad, and it was hard! I was exhausted every single day and it was rewarding in a lot of ways, but I also came out of that experience with some good clarity that this isn't the best way that I can contribute to this space. \\n\\n>==*You have to be the kind of person that can actually get energized from that. When I see that lightbulb go off for a kid, that's the best thing in the world.*==\\n\\nIf you're doing more of the behind the scenes work, you can be very mission oriented and practice different skills. But, you have to be okay with having a little bit more distance from the student. You're working on more systems and processes, and working more through the principals and assistant principals than you are in the classroom with kids. \\n\\n**Were there any activities or classes you leveraged at Penn around education?**\\n\\nI loved volunteering, and the [West Philadelphia Tutoring Project](http://upennwptp.weebly.com/) was my first exposure to working in schools in West Philly. I also took this class with Professor Richard Shell on advanced negotiations.

Ruchi really put into perspective how college students can use their skills to make a social change.</em></h2>\n<p><strong>So you went from consulting to the Clorox Company to data in education — wow. To start off can you give us a quick preface of your interesting career journey.</strong></p>\n<p>I started off doing marketing consulting. Marketing is an area that people often treated as very fuzzy, but I knew that there was a very analytical side of it, and wanted to learn it. After a few years in New York City, I went back for my MBA at Kellogg to move into brand management.</p>\n<p>When I decided to make a career switch, I had a family situation. I lost my father, and it made me take a step back from my career and really think about what I wanted to do. During that time I realized that I spent a lot of personal time volunteering in the education space, but I had never thought about it as a career before. So I just decided to jump in and see how I could contribute.</p>\n<p>My first role in education was on the data team for a network of charter schools called KIPP. Now I oversee the operations, tech, and data departments here.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s quite a shift to jump from private sector into public sector. Did you use any resources to help you make that transition?</strong></p>\n<p>I joined the <a href=\"http://www.broadcenter.org/residency/\">Broad Residency</a>, which is a project funded by billionaire Eli Broad. They find people at higher levels of talent in the private sector and get them to switch to the education industry. Through this, I got a master's degree in Education Leadership. It was a rigorous program but worth it — it helped me make connections with different school districts and charter organizations that if I had applied to right off the bat, they likely would not have understood my previous private industry experience. There's also a program called <a href=\"http://www.educationpioneers.org/\">Education Pioneers</a> that takes in people of all levels.</p>\n<div id=\"too-many-unknowns\"></div>\n**What's the most challenging analytics project you've done so far?**\n<p>Everything is really challenging. It’s not like university research in which you have thousands of students that you're running regressions off of. Right now in education, there's a big trend around blended learning through the use of technology in schools and programs like Khan Academy. <em>(Editor's note: Blended education is a style of teaching that combines online video instruction with instructor-led practices)</em></p>\n<p>We're always trying to understand if that has a positive impact on our students’ education. But, I think the lesson learned is exactly as you stated — there are so many things going on with individual students that it's hard to come up with broad generalizations. It's not as simple as this group of kids used the program and this other group didn't. In reality, they have different teachers, they might have used the program differently for a different amount of time, or they might have started at a different level than another class. So there are just so many factors that it's really hard to understand the benefit of some of these programs when they're used so differently.</p>\n<p>One of the things I’ve learned from that is not to get too caught up in needing statistically significant regression analyses all the time. Oftentimes, you can get quick directional learning that is enough to make you feel confident to make a decision without getting everything perfect.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark><em>It's like that mantra that “perfect can be the enemy of good”, and it can get in your way if you try to do something to the T.</em></mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div id=\"education-reform\"></div>\n**What are some metrics you have to see how successful KIPP is being in engaging the students, outside of just traditional test scores and performance?**\n<p>First of all, we try to get teachers who look like our students because they can connect better. There is a difference when you're a young black boy and you have a black male teacher. We want them to have role models and see the world of possibilities and professions there are for them.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, we think a lot about being what we call “culturally competent”. Kids know when you genuinely care about them. A lot of our focus of being culturally responsive is to not use the textbooks that are written by the winners.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark><em>In the U.S., a lot of the winners are white, so we try to have a lot of different texts in the classroom written by authors that are Latino, African American, Native American, or Asian American — just all different backgrounds.</em></mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We want to compare other narratives and perspectives with every moment in history we’re teaching about. The core thing is building relationships and recognizing that education should reflect and celebrate their background as well.</p>\n<p><strong>How much of a role does KIPP try to play in tackling social issues these kids face that interfere with their education (e.g. poverty, racial discrimination, parental incarceration)?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest things we do is focusing as equally on culture and character-building as we do on academics. Ninety percent scores on a state test doesn’t necessarily mean students will automatically thrive if they went to a school like Penn. We build their character up to help them succeed anywhere, focusing on curiosity, social intelligence, self-control, and independent thinking.</p>\n<p>Culture is a big part of our school because of the unstable home conditions that many students may come from. We have a lot of school support, including psychologists and mental health professionals. We try to focus on restorative practices, emotional learning, and anything to keep students involved in school instead of outside. If a student misbehaves, instead of suspending them, we keep them in the school community and teach them why their behavior is wrong, how to respond to conflicts in a non-physical way, and ways to solve them. School is a safe-haven for these students. We train our teachers on classroom management and how to deal with these types of issues. There’s a lot going on in these students’ lives and we need to give them an outlet here.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have a certain memory or anything that you keep to motivate yourself every day to keep striving in this role?</strong></p>\n<p>I think of my dad a lot. When my dad passed away from cancer, I reflected on my career and committed to making this change. We are an immigrant family and he worked so hard to get me access to the education that I had. My parents instilled the value of education in me forever. In my household, it was <em>when</em> you go to college, not <em>if</em> you go to college. Growing up, I never realized that could be different from other families and took it for granted. I think of him and tell my story often because it's important for other people to know why I’m committed to this work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark><em>Even though I haven't been much of a teacher myself, I chose this very consciously and believe in it because education has leveled the playing field for my family firsthand.</em></mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I'm sorry to hear that. It's great that you were able to turn it into such strong motivation. What do you try to work on now to advance the future of education?</strong></p>\n<p>Technology's got to be a critical part of education because it's a critical part of our everyday lives. A lot of our students don't have access to computers in their home. If we didn't have Chromebooks in our classroom, then we would be missing out on the opportunity to give our kids exposure to what they may see every day at work.</p>\n<p>One part will be universal basic access to technology in a classroom. Then the second part is using that technology to provide good teaching content. Our teachers are absolutely incredible, and they work so hard. To have access to materials that could make their job a little bit more sustainable, so that they're not always creating lesson plans from scratch is a big deal.</p>\n<p>Part of this comes with the rise of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). The idea that people all around the world can have access to quality education is great. I hope that we leverage it more.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s interesting you mention MOOCs. Some people love that they can replace formalized education and allow anyone to gain skills on their own. But one big issue they're running into is the low retention rate, low engagement rate, and accountability problem.</strong></p>\n<p>Can I add to that? I think MOOCs have a different goal. MOOCs want more access. They're breaking that barrier to access and giving a broad range of people access to content they wouldn't have access to otherwise. It is achieving that, but like you said, there's a major retention problem.</p>\n<p>When we're talking elementary, middle, and high school, we're talking about the core content of public education. So the goal isn't just access. It’s to actually master the content. If you just leave them on their own with the material, you don't have that interplay to really understand if they're mastering the content. It's more of how do we layer this with the teacher to give people different ways to interact with the material and master the different skills that we're trying to teach.</p>\n<div id=\"make-an-impact\"></div>\n**Shifting to the careers side, what do you suggest students interested in working in education do to prepare?** \n<p>They should get exposure to what the classroom looks like and getting in front of kids, whether it's through a volunteer assignment or student teaching. By getting in front of kids regularly, you can understand if that's what motivates you. I taught English just one summer abroad, and it was hard! I was exhausted every single day and it was rewarding in a lot of ways, but I also came out of that experience with some good clarity that this isn't the best way that I can contribute to this space.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark><em>You have to be the kind of person that can actually get energized from that. When I see that lightbulb go off for a kid, that's the best thing in the world.</em></mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you're doing more of the behind the scenes work, you can be very mission oriented and practice different skills. But, you have to be okay with having a little bit more distance from the student. You're working on more systems and processes, and working more through the principals and assistant principals than you are in the classroom with kids.</p>\n<p><strong>Were there any activities or classes you leveraged at Penn around education?</strong></p>\n<p>I loved volunteering, and the <a href=\"http://upennwptp.weebly.com/\">West Philadelphia Tutoring Project</a> was my first exposure to working in schools in West Philly. I also took this class with Professor Richard Shell on advanced negotiations. Classes like that make you reflect and think about material in a different way. <em>(Editor's note: Professor Shell's <a href=\"https://lgst.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/shellric/#teaching\">negotiations classes</a> include OIDD291 and LGST206).</em></p>\n<p><strong>Are there any books that influenced you or inspired you most?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I read a ton of education books.

But at this point I'd been bitten by the bug and I said, \\\"Wow, trying to start a company was much much more genuine and challenging and invigorating than being in a law firm.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so the question I faced then was the question that many people who are graduating from Penn are thinking about: how to move in an entrepreneurial direction. I'm guessing most Penn students do not think they're situated such that they could start a company today and that's probably right. So the way I tried to develop was I worked for more experienced entrepreneurs, first at a mobile software company that did not work out. And then at a healthcare software company where I learned a lot, then I eventually became the CEO of Manhattan Prep. That was the fourth or fifth startup I worked at and then that company grew and grew and I had a great run with that company for the next five and a half years. \\n\\nSo I can relate to many of the anxieties and issues that Penn students are facing. You're some of the best students in the country and get heavily recruited by name-brand banking, consulting, and tech firms, and it seems like a no brainer to compete for those offers and take them. \\n\\nOn the flip side though some of you have spent summers at these firms and have not enjoyed it. Or you have friends who are at these firms and tell you horror stories about how they don't enjoy it and have very little time outside of work. And so you think: Wow, is this really what success is like? Am I supposed to take one of these jobs and compete because I'm supposed to? And is there is there something else I could or should be doing? But the other alternatives don't come to Penn and recruit you. So it's a really challenging landscape. And people who go to graduate programs in my experience end up deferring those issues for several years and then face them eventually anyway.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"creativity\\\"></div>\\n\\n**If you were back in college would you study something other than economics or law?**\\n\\nI would either be technical or creative if I could do it over again. I think because we are in a world where if you are technical you can create opportunities for yourself more easily. But I think that creativity is at a premium now today too. And it's interesting how little creativity finds its way into many corporate contexts. \\n\\n**And what do you mean by being creative?**\\n\\nThe way I see creativity is being in touch with something that you originate and feel strongly enough where you want to bring it into the world. When most people hear creative they think artist, musician, or writer. And those are manifestations of creativity. But to me creativity can mean starting an organization that you think solves a problem, rounding up people to do something that you care about, or building a business. And I think the act of putting out into the world something you believe in and trying to get people to pay attention to it or rally to it is creativity.\\n\\n**And would you say creativity is a skill that can be taught or can be deliberately developed?**\\n\\n>==*We all start out creative. We are then trained away from it. That was my experience when I was an economics major. And so in my case I think I re-discovered my creativity almost a decade later.*==\\n\\nI was named one of the 100 most creative people by Fast Company a few days ago. I was really surprised by it. I don't even consider myself a creative. I've broadened my sense of creativity to include starting organizations and other things. By now I'm a bigger fan of pushing people in those directions. \\n\\nSo if you you're a student at Penn and you're an economics major, it's not necessarily like go take a painting or art class. Instead, reflect on the things that animate you, and understand it doesn't need to be profound. It could just be that your dorm really needs a book club or a basketball club or a potluck. And to make things happen — that's being creative. \\n\\nWhile I was struggling in the startup world in my twenties, I started throwing parties. And the business training from throwing parties is insane. It is some of the the best business training. \\n\\nBut if you think about it, you have to have the vision to get people behind it, you have to organize a team, gather resources, and pay attention to key variables. You also have to be disciplined enough to not care what others think and to a degree also care that they think. So there are things like that that I would advise people to to pursue that you don't think of as creative or business training. But I found them to be very applicable.\\n\\n\\n**Does Venture For America (VFA) become more or less relevant as many jobs and opportunities are taken by machines?**\\n\\nI inventoried all of the companies we work with. And I could not find virtually any that are geared towards dislocating jobs. A lot of this is because of the cities we operate in and the problems they are trying to solve. The vast, vast majority of our companies are what I call generative — if they succeed it's just going to be a win. We're as or more relevant than ever in trying to broaden the growth of businesses and entrepreneurship to more regions because with the increased pace of automation we're going to need more and more vitality and opportunity in places that are not New York or San Francisco.\\n\\n**Do you think initiatives like V.F.A and opportunity zones can keep up with the pace of automation?**\\n\\nI think that Penn students are going to see many dramatic things occur in their careers and lifetimes. \\n\\nNow I'm not worried at all about Penn students because you all are the cream of the crop and there will always be incredible demand for smart people that can help guide organizations and really light the path of innovation. You guys should not be concerned about your own prospects. The dynamics of this economy actually advantage people with your skills and attributes. \\n\\nThat said I think that right now there are many worrying trends in American life that will affect many other people. That will require a very robust set of responses that we're not really realistically initiating right now. And that needs to change. And that's one of the things I'm most driven by. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"everything-will-be-ok\\\"></div>\\n\\n**What can students can do to assist those in parts of society where there have been large displacements of jobs and opportunities?**\\n\\nMaintain a degree of empathy and perspective. When you're young it's very easy to say, \\\"Hey, my career is uncertain. I've got a struggle ahead of me and I need to focus on that.\\\"\\n\\n>==*The single biggest thing is to know that you all are some of the most gifted and sought after young people in the country. So number one maintain empathy. I remember when I was young how anxious I was and it was very hard for me to imagine that no matter what happened, things were going to be fine.*==\\n \\nBut I'm here to tell you that no matter what, things are going to be fine. Take it from someone who was part of several failed companies and is just fine! I'm a part of several failed companies, I owed $100,000 and in law school debt, and I'm still fine. My parents were concerned about it for a little while but now you know they love it and brag about me all the time. \\n\\n>==*The first thing is to know that you're going to be fine. The second thing is to try and make your work generative and part of a solution.*==\\n\\nNow that's a very, very high bar because many of the opportunities that are naturally going to come to Penn students are not going to be generative truthfully. They're going to be market-driven and the market is going to be unkind to many workers in the years to come. So if you can find an organization that if they succeed will end up being a positive force in terms of making opportunities possible for broader numbers of people, that's ideal. If every Penn student were to do that we would actually be in much greater shape because you guys are one of the great collections of human and intellectual capital in the country. So if there were enough Penn students working on generative businesses and companies that would be awesome.\\n\\n**Imagine a scenario where smart and ambitious students work on non-generative solutions that are unkind and market driven. These solutions will drive many into a form of economic uselessness. In that kind of world, where will both students who are working on these unkind market driven solutions and the workers who are continually losing opportunities derive meaning?**\\n\\nYou just summarized two ends of a really profound fundamental generational challenge. The issues you described are really going to be the great project of this era — which is what do millions of people that don't have an economic purpose in the workforce do to forge purpose in their community. And to me there are many possibilities in that direction and we're going to have to meaningfully invest in and explore them. \\n\\nOn the other side if you have a lot of people working on advancing market-based solutions that have neutral or possibly even negative effects for others that may be — and I don't want to let anyone off the hook — but that might be fine if the benefits of that progress are being distributed in ways that make everyone happy.\\n\\nFor example, trucks driving themselves ought to be a good thing. We can't shy away from it. It's just that this is a very important question as to what that means for real people and real families that currently rely upon driving trucks for a living.\\n\\n**And does a universal basic income fix everything?**\\n\\nTo me a universal basic income is a very important part of a set of solutions that we have to consider. Because if you do hit the fast forward button far enough you wind up with a very short list of realistic means of distributing economic value to enough of the population where society continues to advance. It's something that I believe is going to become more and more front and center in the months to come. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"write-it-down\\\"></div>\\n\\n**You've said if there's anything that you learned in the last six years in building VFA it was that all things remain possible if you pursue ideals. What is the story of how you developed your ideals?**\\n\\nI really don't want people to feel this pressure to have a sense of their ideals. When I was a senior in college I had pretty much one priority and that was trying to be cool, whatever cool meant. I was just trying to get a date. Or trying get this person to pay attention to me. In my case values got built over time based upon the people you work with and the things you experience and the organizations you're part of.\\n\\nSo it's not unusual for people to still be grappling with how to articulate their values and how to live those values for years or even decades. It's not unusual. In my case I started to believe that our flow of talent was driving problems for both the people involved in our economy and society and I wanted to change that.\\n\\nAnd I've been situated such that I believe I could change this problem, which is not a realistic ambition for a lot of people. \\n\\n>==*And what's funny is I kind of knew that I was part of a moderately narrow group that could have a positive impact if I busted my back for a number of years. So I felt like I needed to do it because if I didn't I'd be failing to live up to my potential.*==\\n\\nSo don't sweat it if you're still figuring out what it is that you're most motivated by or which you care mostly deeply about. The key is that when the time does come — and it will come — where the universe does speak to you and realize this may be your chance to do something important then you have to take that first big step. The first big step is the hardest. After you take the first big step the other steps just start following. \\n\\nBut you have to maintain a sensitivity to what opportunities come your way and what chances you get to work on the things you care about. One piece of advice I would leave you with is that you should write down the things you want for yourself, the things you care about, and the things you want to work on. I did that. \\n\\nAnd then when the opportunities arose to work on those things I said: \\\"Well, I wrote it down.\\\" So I was either lying or I need to do this. Writing it down to helps make it real. I was talking to one guy who moved to Ohio and co-founded a venture capital firm there to help the region. He told me he'd written down a list of things he'd like to do in his life. One of them was create thousands of jobs for people that wouldn't have them otherwise. And so he said when the governor of Ohio called him and said, \\\"Hey, come to Ohio and become my economic development leader?\\\" And he replied, \\\"That's on my list!\\\" \\n\\n>==*And the same thing happened to me when I had a list of things that I wanted to do. And so when I thought I could try and accomplish some of them with Venture for America I did it. So if you write down what you want to do and what you care about it will prove immensely valuable over time.*==\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><h5 id=\"editorsthreekeytakeaways\"><strong>Editor's Three Key Takeaways:</strong></h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Step away from the conventional definitions of creativity.

That was the fourth or fifth startup I worked at and then that company\ngrew and grew and I had a great run with that company for the next five and a\nhalf years.\n\nSo I can relate to many of the anxieties and issues that Penn students are\nfacing. You're some of the best students in the country and get heavily\nrecruited by name-brand banking, consulting, and tech firms, and it seems like a\nno brainer to compete for those offers and take them.\n\nOn the flip side though some of you have spent summers at these firms and have\nnot enjoyed it. Or you have friends who are at these firms and tell you horror\nstories about how they don't enjoy it and have very little time outside of work.\nAnd so you think: Wow, is this really what success is like? Am I supposed to\ntake one of these jobs and compete because I'm supposed to? And is there is\nthere something else I could or should be doing? But the other alternatives\ndon't come to Penn and recruit you. So it's a really challenging landscape. And\npeople who go to graduate programs in my experience end up deferring those\nissues for several years and then face them eventually anyway.\n\nIf you were back in college would you study something other than economics or\nlaw?\n\nI would either be technical or creative if I could do it over again. I think\nbecause we are in a world where if you are technical you can create\nopportunities for yourself more easily. But I think that creativity is at a\npremium now today too. And it's interesting how little creativity finds its way\ninto many corporate contexts.\n\nAnd what do you mean by being creative?\n\nThe way I see creativity is being in touch with something that you originate and\nfeel strongly enough where you want to bring it into the world. When most people\nhear creative they think artist, musician, or writer. And those are\nmanifestations of creativity. But to me creativity can mean starting an\norganization that you think solves a problem, rounding up people to do something\nthat you care about, or building a business. And I think the act of putting out\ninto the world something you believe in and trying to get people to pay\nattention to it or rally to it is creativity.\n\nAnd would you say creativity is a skill that can be taught or can be\ndeliberately developed?\n\nWe all start out creative. We are then trained away from it. That was my\nexperience when I was an economics major. And so in my case I think I\nre-discovered my creativity almost a decade later.\n\nI was named one of the 100 most creative people by Fast Company a few days ago.\nI was really surprised by it. I don't even consider myself a creative. I've\nbroadened my sense of creativity to include starting organizations and other\nthings. By now I'm a bigger fan of pushing people in those directions.\n\nSo if you you're a student at Penn and you're an economics major, it's not\nnecessarily like go take a painting or art class. Instead, reflect on the things\nthat animate you, and understand it doesn't need to be profound. It could just\nbe that your dorm really needs a book club or a basketball club or a potluck.\nAnd to make things happen — that's being creative.\n\nWhile I was struggling in the startup world in my twenties, I started throwing\nparties. And the business training from throwing parties is insane. It is some\nof the the best business training.\n\nBut if you think about it, you have to have the vision to get people behind it,\nyou have to organize a team, gather resources, and pay attention to key\nvariables. You also have to be disciplined enough to not care what others think\nand to a degree also care that they think. So there are things like that that I\nwould advise people to to pursue that you don't think of as creative or business\ntraining. But I found them to be very applicable.\n\nDoes Venture For America (VFA) become more or less relevant as many jobs and\nopportunities are taken by machines?\n\nI inventoried all of the companies we work with. And I could not find virtually\nany that are geared towards dislocating jobs. A lot of this is because of the\ncities we operate in and the problems they are trying to solve. The vast, vast\nmajority of our companies are what I call generative — if they succeed it's just\ngoing to be a win. We're as or more relevant than ever in trying to broaden the\ngrowth of businesses and entrepreneurship to more regions because with the\nincreased pace of automation we're going to need more and more vitality and\nopportunity in places that are not New York or San Francisco.\n\nDo you think initiatives like V.F.A and opportunity zones can keep up with the\npace of automation?\n\nI think that Penn students are going to see many dramatic things occur in their\ncareers and lifetimes.\n\nNow I'm not worried at all about Penn students because you all are the cream of\nthe crop and there will always be incredible demand for smart people that can\nhelp guide organizations and really light the path of innovation. You guys\nshould not be concerned about your own prospects. The dynamics of this economy\nactually advantage people with your skills and attributes.\n\nThat said I think that right now there are many worrying trends in American life\nthat will affect many other people. That will require a very robust set of\nresponses that we're not really realistically initiating right now. And that\nneeds to change. And that's one of the things I'm most driven by.\n\nWhat can students can do to assist those in parts of society where there have\nbeen large displacements of jobs and opportunities?\n\nMaintain a degree of empathy and perspective. When you're young it's very easy\nto say, \"Hey, my career is uncertain. I've got a struggle ahead of me and I need\nto focus on that.\"\n\nThe single biggest thing is to know that you all are some of the most gifted and\nsought after young people in the country. So number one maintain empathy. I\nremember when I was young how anxious I was and it was very hard for me to\nimagine that no matter what happened, things were going to be fine.\n\nBut I'm here to tell you that no matter what, things are going to be fine. Take\nit from someone who was part of several failed companies and is just fine! I'm a\npart of several failed companies, I owed $100,000 and in law school debt, and\nI'm still fine. My parents were concerned about it for a little while but now\nyou know they love it and brag about me all the time.\n\nThe first thing is to know that you're going to be fine. The second thing is to\ntry and make your work generative and part of a solution.\n\nNow that's a very, very high bar because many of the opportunities that are\nnaturally going to come to Penn students are not going to be generative\ntruthfully. They're going to be market-driven and the market is going to be\nunkind to many workers in the years to come. So if you can find an organization\nthat if they succeed will end up being a positive force in terms of making\nopportunities possible for broader numbers of people, that's ideal. If every\nPenn student were to do that we would actually be in much greater shape because\nyou guys are one of the great collections of human and intellectual capital in\nthe country. So if there were enough Penn students working on generative\nbusinesses and companies that would be awesome.\n\nImagine a scenario where smart and ambitious students work on non-generative\nsolutions that are unkind and market driven. These solutions will drive many\ninto a form of economic uselessness. In that kind of world, where will both\nstudents who are working on these unkind market driven solutions and the workers\nwho are continually losing opportunities derive meaning?\n\nYou just summarized two ends of a really profound fundamental generational\nchallenge. The issues you described are really going to be the great project of\nthis era — which is what do millions of people that don't have an economic\npurpose in the workforce do to forge purpose in their community. And to me there\nare many possibilities in that direction and we're going to have to meaningfully\ninvest in and explore them.\n\nOn the other side if you have a lot of people working on advancing market-based\nsolutions that have neutral or possibly even negative effects for others that\nmay be — and I don't want to let anyone off the hook — but that might be fine if\nthe benefits of that progress are being distributed in ways that make everyone\nhappy.\n\nFor example, trucks driving themselves ought to be a good thing. We can't shy\naway from it. It's just that this is a very important question as to what that\nmeans for real people and real families that currently rely upon driving trucks\nfor a living.\n\nAnd does a universal basic income fix everything?\n\nTo me a universal basic income is a very important part of a set of solutions\nthat we have to consider. Because if you do hit the fast forward button far\nenough you wind up with a very short list of realistic means of distributing\neconomic value to enough of the population where society continues to advance.\nIt's something that I believe is going to become more and more front and center\nin the months to come.\n\nYou've said if there's anything that you learned in the last six years in\nbuilding VFA it was that all things remain possible if you pursue ideals. What\nis the story of how you developed your ideals?\n\nI really don't want people to feel this pressure to have a sense of their\nideals. When I was a senior in college I had pretty much one priority and that\nwas trying to be cool, whatever cool meant. I was just trying to get a date. Or\ntrying get this person to pay attention to me. In my case values got built over\ntime based upon the people you work with and the things you experience and the\norganizations you're part of.\n\nSo it's not unusual for people to still be grappling with how to articulate\ntheir values and how to live those values for years or even decades. It's not\nunusual. In my case I started to believe that our flow of talent was driving\nproblems for both the people involved in our economy and society and I wanted to\nchange that.\n\nAnd I've been situated such that I believe I could change this problem, which is\nnot a realistic ambition for a lot of people.\n\nAnd what's funny is I kind of knew that I was part of a moderately narrow group\nthat could have a positive impact if I busted my back for a number of years. So\nI felt like I needed to do it because if I didn't I'd be failing to live up to\nmy potential.\n\nSo don't sweat it if you're still figuring out what it is that you're most\nmotivated by or which you care mostly deeply about. The key is that when the\ntime does come — and it will come — where the universe does speak to you and\nrealize this may be your chance to do something important then you have to take\nthat first big step. The first big step is the hardest. After you take the first\nbig step the other steps just start following.\n\nBut you have to maintain a sensitivity to what opportunities come your way and\nwhat chances you get to work on the things you care about. One piece of advice I\nwould leave you with is that you should write down the things you want for\nyourself, the things you care about, and the things you want to work on. I did\nthat.\n\nAnd then when the opportunities arose to work on those things I said: \"Well, I\nwrote it down.\" So I was either lying or I need to do this. Writing it down to\nhelps make it real. I was talking to one guy who moved to Ohio and co-founded a\nventure capital firm there to help the region. He told me he'd written down a\nlist of things he'd like to do in his life. One of them was create thousands of\njobs for people that wouldn't have them otherwise. And so he said when the\ngovernor of Ohio called him and said, \"Hey, come to Ohio and become my economic\ndevelopment leader?\" And he replied, \"That's on my list!\"\n\nAnd the same thing happened to me when I had a list of things that I wanted to\ndo. And so when I thought I could try and accomplish some of them with Venture\nfor America I did it. So if you write down what you want to do and what you care\nabout it will prove immensely valuable over time.","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/05/andrew_yang.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"Andrew Yang discusses the future of work and the importance of solving meaningful problems in a fast changing society.","author_id":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85a","created_at":"2017-04-12 04:07:10","created_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85f","updated_at":"2017-06-08 19:49:13","updated_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85b","published_at":"2017-05-03 20:39:13","published_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85d"},{"id":"5ba832145ee55800011ab910","uuid":"4c50706f-8449-4d00-8ad1-395891abd085","title":"Let us know what you want!","slug":"survey","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"<div class=\\\"typeform-widget\\\" data-url=\\\"https://kasra5.typeform.com/to/cBuAMH\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 500px;\\\"></div><script>(function(){var qs,js,q,s,d=document,gi=d.getElementById,ce=d.createElement,gt=d.getElementsByTagName,id=\\\"typef_orm\\\",b=\\\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/share.typeform.com/\\\";if(!gi.call(d,id)){js=ce.call(d,\\\"script\\\");js.id=id;js.src=b+\\\"widget.js\\\";q=gt.call(d,\\\"script\\\")[0];q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q)}})()</script>\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><div class=\"typeform-widget\" data-url=\"https://kasra5.typeform.com/to/cBuAMH\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 500px;\"></div><script>(function(){var qs,js,q,s,d=document,gi=d.getElementById,ce=d.createElement,gt=d.getElementsByTagName,id=\"typef_orm\",b=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/share.typeform.com/\";if(!gi.call(d,id)){js=ce.call(d,\"script\");js.id=id;js.src=b+\"widget.js\";q=gt.call(d,\"script\")[0];q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q)}})()</script></div>","amp":"34","plaintext":"","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/04/questions.jpg","featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5ba832115ee55800011ab859","created_at":"2017-04-17 00:25:20","created_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab859","updated_at":"2017-04-17 00:28:25","updated_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab859","published_at":"2017-04-17 00:26:39","published_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab859"},{"id":"5ba832145ee55800011ab911","uuid":"9c09750b-b5fe-479f-8266-a4390fa1f32a","title":"Curtis Lee on Thinking Inwards Before Outwards","slug":"curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"#####**Editor’s Three Key Takeaways**\\n\\n1. It’s important to [reflect and think about what *actually* excites you and motivates you](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#reflect). \\n2. [Take steps towards developing the skills you want and finding a network of passionate people from whom you’d want to learn and work with](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#skills). \\n3. You should [take risks and minimize regret](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#minimize-regret)! It’s much easier to take risks now — the repercussions of failing are more costly when you get older. [Take as many opportunities to explore, learn, and find out what you’re good at](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#learn).\\n([Penn would be a good place to do just that!](http://thesign.al/curtis-lee-on-thinking-inwards-before-outwards/#penn)) \\n\\nCurtis Lee is the founder and CEO of a startup called [Luxe](http://www.luxevalet.com/), which offers on-demand parking and valet services. After spending a frustrating 40 minutes trying to find parking before a dinner, he came up with the idea (on a napkin at the restaurant) to have someone meet you at your destination and park your car for you. Late April 2017 (after this interview), Luxe decided to [end its valet service operations](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/luxe-to-end-door-to-door-valet-service-in-san-francisco-at-the-end-of-may/) and will launch a new service in the summer.\\n\\nCurtis only became an entrepreneur later in life: after graduating the University of California Berkeley with a degree in Economics, he followed a “typical” finance path before attending the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business for his MBA. Afterwards, he chose to work at tech companies including Google, Zynga, and Groupon, before starting Luxe in San Francisco. (He’s also a “Believer of the Impossible,” according to his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/curtislee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).) \\n ------\\n**Penn is really pre-professional, and people just end up falling into finance or consulting, even if they do not like it. How were you able to ultimately pursue Luxe?** \\n\\nYou mentioned this idea that people in school tend to follow the crowd. They do things that they think are proven paths to take, and oftentimes it's a plan of their parents; they say, “You can be a doctor, you can be an investment banker,” or whatever it is. But, just as the world has changed, the job market has fundamentally changed as well. And so maybe the way to think about this is the *risks that you don’t take are actually the bigger risks that you have to deal with in your life*. People at Penn are very smart, motivated, with high IQs. And so no matter what they up doing, they’ll do pretty well. It’s about the direction in which you go. People that do well are ones that 10, 20, or 30 years after they graduate, they're extremely passionate and happy with their jobs. You get that by following what really gets you motivated. It’s hard, but you should think from *inwards to outwards*. Anytime people have made an “inward-to-outward” decision, I feel like it’s led to a better, more satisfying outcome than just an “outward” decision. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"reflect\\\"> Now there's a whole separate question of where did you find your passion: in school, or maybe you couldn't find it at all, or maybe you need to take some time, but I think it’s worth the extra effort to take a year off to self-reflect. \\n> == *I know it sounds so sacrilegious not to have a job after graduation, but it’s worth taking that one year or six months off to really think about it and then ultimately deciding your career, instead of jumping into something and spending two to three years on something that’s ultimately a big waste of time.* ==\\n\\nTaking it back to me, I think I could have done Luxe a lot earlier had I followed my advice to you, but it took some time for me to understand these life lessons. Around Luxe specifically, I saw a need and a novel approach for fixing a situation. It’s a personal problem of mine, so I’m passionate about it. And, I had a team of people who I wanted to work with. So when you have a combination of a great team and you have something that you want to build, that’s an opportunity to actually start a company. That's what I ended up doing. \\n\\nMy philosophy on my career at that point in time, only a few years ago, is that you got to take some chances and minimize the regret you have in your life, the risks you think you should’ve taken. \\n>==*The repercussions from failure are much easier when you’re younger. You're not typecast as a person that's failed and you learn from it and move on.*==\\n \\nWhereas when you get older or further in your career, there’s less opportunity — the risk of failing is higher. It gets significantly harder to take on risk when you’re older. There’s more at stake.\\n\\nSo my point on all of this is that after you graduate you should find something that you're extremely passionate about, and find a set of people that you're excited about doing something with. *And if that means that you have to go to a large company to find that network, so be it*. At Penn, you can find the intelligent people that you really like working with. And then you have to find a problem you’re passion about. \\n\\n**So about finding the right people, how were you able to find teammates who were just as passionate as you were?** \\n\\nI think it's a common problem where a lot of people come in more dedicated and devoted than others. I think the key is that you have to work with a person for a while, like a feeling-out process. There's no reason you have to say, “Hey you, you and I should start a company right now,” when we haven't even worked together. So I think there should be a track history of working together in a company or working on a project together at school, so we know how we act and behave especially under pressure. And secondly, you have to find people whose motivations are similar to yours. \\n\\n**It seems like you’ve always had this entrepreneurial spirit (since age 10, according to this Forbes article). Coming to Wharton for your MBA, how did you explore that passion for entrepreneurship?**\\n\\n<div id=\\\"minimize-regret\\\"> If you look at my pre-MBA, post-undergrad career, it was very safe, the typical finance path: investment banking, private equity funds, venture capital funds. At the time I graduated, it was sort the “cool” path everyone wanted to follow. I felt sort of trapped. I didn't really think about if this was what I wanted to do. The summer before I entered business school, my grandmother ended up passing away. I got to spend time with her at the hospital, and she told me she had a lot of regret in her life, regret that she didn't pursue all the passions. I think that really shook me to the core. Life is super precious. If you always had that dream or passion about doing something on your own, and you never had the guts to go do it — all that stuff goes away at that point in time. If you ever need a point of motivation or a moment of clarity, spend some time in a retirement home because it will really start to clarify what's important in your life.\\n<div>\\nSo entering business school, I pivoted what I wanted to do out of business school, which was I wanted to eventually start a company. So I geared my education and the internships that I got towards making that a reality. \\n<div>\\nI did take an entrepreneurship class. In my first year, there was a hardcore entrepreneur in my class, who, after his first year, ended up working on his idea and never came back. He dropped out of Wharton and started the company, [AdMob](https://www.google.com/admob/), which he sold to Google for $750 million dollars. You have a guy who saw a need. He was passionate about it, started building it himself. He could've taken a much more conservative path, could have said, \\\"I'll just wait one more year. I could work on it on the side.\\\" But he said, \\\"I'm going to work on this no matter what because the opportunity is now.\\\" And it all worked out for him. \\n>==*Real entrepreneurship is like [burning the boats](http://travisrobertson.com/leadership/burn-ships-succeed-die/) and saying, “I'm going to work on this, come hell or high water and make it work.” And you go out and do it.*==\\n\\n**So after pivoting in business school and to the point when you started Luxe, how did you make career changes and job changes? How did you get the knowledge, insight, or skills in order to start Luxe?**\\n<div id=\\\"skills\\\"> I went from a pure finance path to wanting to start a technology company. I felt like that was where the momentum of the world was moving to: technology will continue to be a growth center for at least like 50 years, in my opinion. So I wanted to be in that space. When I was in finance, I spent some time on some early stage technology investments, got to see a lot of technology company pitches, so I was pretty familiar with a lot of the trends. \\n\\nBut I never really had the skills around building something, so that’s first and foremost. I knew I had a passion for building things. Often when you start a company, you're building something from scratch. So I needed those skill sets, as well as a network of people that I could start a company with (engineers and product people). \\n>==*So I figured out a plan to develop those skills and people. And I did that by getting a job at Google after graduation (from Wharton MBA). I tried to move more towards that path of product management, getting acclimated, learning from the best and brightest people, and then ultimately building a network of people.*== \\n\\nAnd every step of the way I tried to get more skills, get more leadership responsibilities, and finally when I had an idea, a dream that I thought was worthy of jumping in and taking a chance, that's exactly what I did. \\n\\n**You went to UC Berkeley as an undergrad, and then Wharton for your MBA. What would you say is the difference between your Wharton experience versus UC Berkeley?** \\n\\nBroadly speaking, the benefit you get from a Bay Area school is the environment. Some of the most amazing companies are right in your backyard. You could do internships at a lot of these companies and network at a bunch of events. Penn students have to work harder on reaching out to technology and entrepreneurial people to come to campus, finding a way to get in touch with them and being inspired by them. \\n<div id=\\\"penn\\\"> You have tons of great entrepreneurs who came to Penn though. Penn does have an entrepreneurial culture of people — Wharton people or computer science people — who want to start companies and change the world. While Philadelphia may not be the best place for technology or entrepreneurship, Penn’s school environment is much tighter and better, at least against Berkeley, which is a public school. At Berkeley, there's much more of a sink-or-swim mentality, you can get lost in the shuffle because you're one of thousands and thousands of people. In private schools, there's much more cohesion, and you're set up more for success because the school has more resources. \\n<div>\\n**What would you want Wharton or Penn to improve on with preparing students to be entrepreneurs, careers in tech, or just in general promoting an entrepreneurial mindset?** \\n<div>\\nI think Wharton in particular needs to broaden the exposure and its positioning to go beyond finance. Even when I talk to people now, they go \\\"You must have gotten a great finance education.\\\" And I think that's a missed opportunity. I think there are opportunities to work hand-in-hand with companies and incubators. One of our investors, who runs YC ([Y-Combinator](www.ycombinator.com), a renowned startup incubator), sent out a Tweet two days ago, saying that business schools don't train their students very well for entrepreneurship. A few hours later, he sent another tweet saying that the Harvard and Stanford business schools were the only two schools that reached out to him, saying they're willing to work with him and YC to improve their curriculum. I wish Wharton reached out to him too. If YC, which is like the best incubator out there, is willing to reach out to schools and help them, then I think that's an opportunity. \\n<div>\\nSpending some time working at a real company as part of the curriculum would be valuable. Maybe Penn could team up with companies nearby and have students work on a project on behalf of the company. This would give students more real life experience. I also think changing some of the curriculum to be less theoretical and more practical would be interesting as well. Penn could tailor classes more readily around topics that actually matter in entrepreneurship, like sales. Sales is an example of something that an entrepreneur does all the time, and no one talks about that. \\n<div>\\n**What advice do you have for students who don't think they have the skills but would want to be involved in tech and entrepreneurship?** \\n\\n<div id=\\\"learn\\\"> I'd say that for people your age, *you still have a lot of time*. For people my age, I'd say focus on your strengths, don't focus on your weaknesses. I've taken some coding classes, but I'm only going to be a mediocre coder unless I spend a ton of time developing my skills. So rather than doing that, I have a competitive advantage with product knowledge, analytical skills, and creativity. So that's where I focus my efforts on.

After spending a frustrating 40 minutes trying to find parking before a dinner, he came up with the idea (on a napkin at the restaurant) to have someone meet you at your destination and park your car for you. Late April 2017 (after this interview), Luxe decided to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/luxe-to-end-door-to-door-valet-service-in-san-francisco-at-the-end-of-may/\">end its valet service operations</a> and will launch a new service in the summer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"curtisonlybecameanentrepreneurlaterinlifeaftergraduatingtheuniversityofcaliforniaberkeleywithadegreeineconomicshefollowedatypicalfinancepathbeforeattendingtheuniversityofpennsylvaniawhartonschoolofbusinessforhismbaafterwardshechosetoworkattechcompaniesincludinggooglezyngaandgrouponbeforestartingluxeinsanfranciscohesalsoabelieveroftheimpossibleaccordingtohistwitter\">Curtis only became an entrepreneur later in life: after graduating the University of California Berkeley with a degree in Economics, he followed a “typical” finance path before attending the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business for his MBA. Afterwards, he chose to work at tech companies including Google, Zynga, and Groupon, before starting Luxe in San Francisco. (He’s also a “Believer of the Impossible,” according to his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/curtislee?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>.)</h2>\n<p><strong>Penn is really pre-professional, and people just end up falling into finance or consulting, even if they do not like it. How were you able to ultimately pursue Luxe?</strong></p>\n<p>You mentioned this idea that people in school tend to follow the crowd. They do things that they think are proven paths to take, and oftentimes it's a plan of their parents; they say, “You can be a doctor, you can be an investment banker,” or whatever it is. But, just as the world has changed, the job market has fundamentally changed as well. And so maybe the way to think about this is the <em>risks that you don’t take are actually the bigger risks that you have to deal with in your life</em>. People at Penn are very smart, motivated, with high IQs. And so no matter what they up doing, they’ll do pretty well. It’s about the direction in which you go. People that do well are ones that 10, 20, or 30 years after they graduate, they're extremely passionate and happy with their jobs. You get that by following what really gets you motivated. It’s hard, but you should think from <em>inwards to outwards</em>. Anytime people have made an “inward-to-outward” decision, I feel like it’s led to a better, more satisfying outcome than just an “outward” decision.</p>\n<div id=\"reflect\"> Now there's a whole separate question of where did you find your passion: in school, or maybe you couldn't find it at all, or maybe you need to take some time, but I think it’s worth the extra effort to take a year off to self-reflect. \n> == *I know it sounds so sacrilegious not to have a job after graduation, but it’s worth taking that one year or six months off to really think about it and then ultimately deciding your career, instead of jumping into something and spending two to three years on something that’s ultimately a big waste of time.* ==\n<p>Taking it back to me, I think I could have done Luxe a lot earlier had I followed my advice to you, but it took some time for me to understand these life lessons. Around Luxe specifically, I saw a need and a novel approach for fixing a situation. It’s a personal problem of mine, so I’m passionate about it. And, I had a team of people who I wanted to work with. So when you have a combination of a great team and you have something that you want to build, that’s an opportunity to actually start a company. That's what I ended up doing.</p>\n<p>My philosophy on my career at that point in time, only a few years ago, is that you got to take some chances and minimize the regret you have in your life, the risks you think you should’ve taken.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark><em>The repercussions from failure are much easier when you’re younger. You're not typecast as a person that's failed and you learn from it and move on.</em></mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whereas when you get older or further in your career, there’s less opportunity — the risk of failing is higher. It gets significantly harder to take on risk when you’re older. There’s more at stake.</p>\n<p>So my point on all of this is that after you graduate you should find something that you're extremely passionate about, and find a set of people that you're excited about doing something with. <em>And if that means that you have to go to a large company to find that network, so be it</em>. At Penn, you can find the intelligent people that you really like working with. And then you have to find a problem you’re passion about.</p>\n<p><strong>So about finding the right people, how were you able to find teammates who were just as passionate as you were?</strong></p>\n<p>I think it's a common problem where a lot of people come in more dedicated and devoted than others. I think the key is that you have to work with a person for a while, like a feeling-out process. There's no reason you have to say, “Hey you, you and I should start a company right now,” when we haven't even worked together. So I think there should be a track history of working together in a company or working on a project together at school, so we know how we act and behave especially under pressure. And secondly, you have to find people whose motivations are similar to yours.</p>\n<p><strong>It seems like you’ve always had this entrepreneurial spirit (since age 10, according to this Forbes article). Coming to Wharton for your MBA, how did you explore that passion for entrepreneurship?</strong></p>\n<div id=\"minimize-regret\"> If you look at my pre-MBA, post-undergrad career, it was very safe, the typical finance path: investment banking, private equity funds, venture capital funds. At the time I graduated, it was sort the “cool” path everyone wanted to follow. I felt sort of trapped. I didn't really think about if this was what I wanted to do. The summer before I entered business school, my grandmother ended up passing away. I got to spend time with her at the hospital, and she told me she had a lot of regret in her life, regret that she didn't pursue all the passions. I think that really shook me to the core. Life is super precious. If you always had that dream or passion about doing something on your own, and you never had the guts to go do it — all that stuff goes away at that point in time. If you ever need a point of motivation or a moment of clarity, spend some time in a retirement home because it will really start to clarify what's important in your life.\n<div>\nSo entering business school, I pivoted what I wanted to do out of business school, which was I wanted to eventually start a company. So I geared my education and the internships that I got towards making that a reality. \n<div>\nI did take an entrepreneurship class. In my first year, there was a hardcore entrepreneur in my class, who, after his first year, ended up working on his idea and never came back. He dropped out of Wharton and started the company, [AdMob](https://www.google.com/admob/), which he sold to Google for $750 million dollars. You have a guy who saw a need. He was passionate about it, started building it himself. He could've taken a much more conservative path, could have said, \"I'll just wait one more year. I could work on it on the side.\" But he said, \"I'm going to work on this no matter what because the opportunity is now.\" And it all worked out for him. \n>==*Real entrepreneurship is like [burning the boats](http://travisrobertson.com/leadership/burn-ships-succeed-die/) and saying, “I'm going to work on this, come hell or high water and make it work.” And you go out and do it.*==\n<p><strong>So after pivoting in business school and to the point when you started Luxe, how did you make career changes and job changes? How did you get the knowledge, insight, or skills in order to start Luxe?</strong></p>\n<div id=\"skills\"> I went from a pure finance path to wanting to start a technology company. I felt like that was where the momentum of the world was moving to: technology will continue to be a growth center for at least like 50 years, in my opinion. So I wanted to be in that space. When I was in finance, I spent some time on some early stage technology investments, got to see a lot of technology company pitches, so I was pretty familiar with a lot of the trends. \n<p>But I never really had the skills around building something, so that’s first and foremost. I knew I had a passion for building things. Often when you start a company, you're building something from scratch. So I needed those skill sets, as well as a network of people that I could start a company with (engineers and product people).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark><em>So I figured out a plan to develop those skills and people. And I did that by getting a job at Google after graduation (from Wharton MBA). I tried to move more towards that path of product management, getting acclimated, learning from the best and brightest people, and then ultimately building a network of people.</em></mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And every step of the way I tried to get more skills, get more leadership responsibilities, and finally when I had an idea, a dream that I thought was worthy of jumping in and taking a chance, that's exactly what I did.</p>\n<p><strong>You went to UC Berkeley as an undergrad, and then Wharton for your MBA. What would you say is the difference between your Wharton experience versus UC Berkeley?</strong></p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, the benefit you get from a Bay Area school is the environment. Some of the most amazing companies are right in your backyard. You could do internships at a lot of these companies and network at a bunch of events. Penn students have to work harder on reaching out to technology and entrepreneurial people to come to campus, finding a way to get in touch with them and being inspired by them.</p>\n<div id=\"penn\"> You have tons of great entrepreneurs who came to Penn though. Penn does have an entrepreneurial culture of people — Wharton people or computer science people — who want to start companies and change the world. While Philadelphia may not be the best place for technology or entrepreneurship, Penn’s school environment is much tighter and better, at least against Berkeley, which is a public school. At Berkeley, there's much more of a sink-or-swim mentality, you can get lost in the shuffle because you're one of thousands and thousands of people. In private schools, there's much more cohesion, and you're set up more for success because the school has more resources. \n<div>\n**What would you want Wharton or Penn to improve on with preparing students to be entrepreneurs, careers in tech, or just in general promoting an entrepreneurial mindset?** \n<div>\nI think Wharton in particular needs to broaden the exposure and its positioning to go beyond finance. Even when I talk to people now, they go \"You must have gotten a great finance education.\" And I think that's a missed opportunity. I think there are opportunities to work hand-in-hand with companies and incubators. One of our investors, who runs YC ([Y-Combinator](www.ycombinator.com), a renowned startup incubator), sent out a Tweet two days ago, saying that business schools don't train their students very well for entrepreneurship. A few hours later, he sent another tweet saying that the Harvard and Stanford business schools were the only two schools that reached out to him, saying they're willing to work with him and YC to improve their curriculum. I wish Wharton reached out to him too. If YC, which is like the best incubator out there, is willing to reach out to schools and help them, then I think that's an opportunity. \n<div>\nSpending some time working at a real company as part of the curriculum would be valuable. Maybe Penn could team up with companies nearby and have students work on a project on behalf of the company. This would give students more real life experience. I also think changing some of the curriculum to be less theoretical and more practical would be interesting as well. Penn could tailor classes more readily around topics that actually matter in entrepreneurship, like sales. Sales is an example of something that an entrepreneur does all the time, and no one talks about that. \n<div>\n**What advice do you have for students who don't think they have the skills but would want to be involved in tech and entrepreneurship?** \n<div id=\"learn\"> I'd say that for people your age, *you still have a lot of time*. For people my age, I'd say focus on your strengths, don't focus on your weaknesses. I've taken some coding classes, but I'm only going to be a mediocre coder unless I spend a ton of time developing my skills. So rather than doing that, I have a competitive advantage with product knowledge, analytical skills, and creativity. So that's where I focus my efforts on.

As on-campus recruiting (OCR) was pushed to the fall for the first time, from the moment freshmen set foot on campus, the overwhelming presence of professionally-clad upperclassmen with leather portfolios would have made any regular person panic. To alleviate their worries, we made a [public post](https://www.facebook.com/laura.gao.10/posts/1237703422989418) asking upperclassmen to talk about their freshman summer plans. After collecting nearly **70 responses** across 25+ majors, we conducted data analysis to accomplish three things:\\n\\n>1. Paint a **more transparent picture** for future freshmen regarding their first summers \\n2. Provide compelling evidence that freshmen summer plans have **little correlation** towards future plans\\n3. **Connect students to upperclassmen** with all types of summers\\n\\n--------\\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Survey Breakdown\\nFor each participant, we asked the following:\\n![](/content/images/2017/05/data-display-1.png)\\n\\nMost common majors surveyed are in decreasing order: Finance, Management, Operations & Information Decisions, Marketing, Business Analytics, Computer & Information Science, Statistics, and Biology.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\\"/common-majors/\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" id=\\\"commonmajors\\\" style=\\\"height:450px;width:100%;\\\"></iframe>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">*Chart not animating?

Usefulness scores from 1-10, 10 being most useful\\n2. Percentage of people who would redo or change their summer\\n\\nUsefulness scores were described to participants as a “combination of personal and professional development”. The average scores out of 10 for each type of summer are:\\n\\n* Travel/Study Abroad - **7.5**\\n* Tech or Startups - **7.1**\\n* Non-Profit or High School Job - **6.8**\\n* General Business - **5.8**\\n* Research or Classes - **5.6**\\n\\n<iframe src=\\\"/usefulness-scores/\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" id=\\\"usefulness\\\" style=\\\"height:300px;width:100%\\\"></iframe>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">*Chart not animating?

Students who conducted research or took summer classes on campus gave the lowest perceived usefulness score of 5.6. \\n\\nParticipants were also asked if they would redo or change their summer, given the chance. The split between students who would redo their summer vs. students who would keep it unchanged was 38% to 63%. Of the students who would choose to redo their summer, the most common reasons are that students wanted to:\\n\\n* Take advantage of their last chance to travel, be with family, or have fun - **54%**\\n* Explore a field more related to their interests - **21%**\\n* Gain more useful skills - **21%**\\n* Be more prepared before starting an internship - **4%**\\n\\n<div class=\\\"box\\\">\\n<iframe src=\\\"http://thesign.al/redo-by-summer-4-1/\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" id=\\\"redobysummer\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" style=\\\"height:420px;width:320px\\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n<div class=\\\"box\\\">\\n<iframe src=\\\"http://thesign.al/redo-by-summer-4-2/\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" id=\\\"redobysummer2\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" style=\\\"height:420px;width:305px\\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n<svg width=\\\"700\\\" height=\\\"1\\\"></svg><p align=\\\"center\\\">*Chart not animating?

Those who had a formal internship, regardless of whether it was in general business, tech, or  startups, had the highest concentration of people who would redo their summer compared to those without internships.\\n2. The top reason people would have changed or re-done their summer was undoubtedly because it was perceived to be the last full summer to do something they enjoyed. Common alternative activities were staying longer with family, traveling more, or doing more fun things.\\n\\n------\\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Comparing Freshman Summer with Later Career Plans\\nA common fear perpetuated by the pre-professional environment is that the freshmen summer has significant correlation with a student’s future academic and career plans. \\n\\n**However, the data shows that this couldn’t be further from the truth.**\\n\\nLess than a third of the students surveyed (30%) are currently pursuing a career in the same field as that of their summer internship. The fields with the highest conversion rates are:\\n\\n* Tech and Startups - **60%**\\n* Financial Services - **53%**\\n* Marketing & Analytics - **25%**\\n\\n**General business internships was split into financial services and marketing & analytics for more accurate insights*\\n\\nThe pathways chart below shows many of the pivots our participants made from freshmen summer to now:\\n\\n<iframe src=\\\"http://thesign.al/career-pathways/\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" style=\\\"height:730px;width:100%\\\"></iframe>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n\\n**Despite this, one trend that was apparent in the data was the connection between overall summer satisfaction and major pursued.** \\n\\nParticipants were split evenly between those whose internship role matched with their current major and those whose did not. Those whose matched had a significantly higher usefulness score of 7.1 out of 10, compared to only 4.3 out of 10 for those whose did not. It is important to note that we did not collect data on changes in major before and after freshman summer. Thus, it is unclear if freshman summer experiences caused better alignment of major preference or initial major preferences caused a better summer experience. \\n\\n---\\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Summer Search Timeline\\nLastly, we collected data on start and end dates of each participant’s search for summer plans. The average time spent searching was 2.5 months, with the average participant starting in early February and finishing in mid-April. \\n\\nThese dates varied across the different summer types:\\n\\n <googlevistitles>Summer Plans Search Timeline</googlevistitles>\\n <br>\\n <div id=\\\"summerplan_timeline\\\"></div>\\n\\n>######<h6 style=color:#2661c3>Key Takeaways:\\n\\n>1. When analyzing correlations between timelines and summer perceptions, there was no change in average usefulness scores regardless of the length of time spent searching for plans. Thus, searching for longer does not necessarily result in a “higher quality” summer.\\n2. Students who traveled or studied abroad both started and finished the earliest. Such programs typically close applications in early spring; thus we recommend freshmen who are pursuing these plans to prepare early.\\n3. Students who conducted research or took classes on campus had the shortest search timeline. These students recommend being proactive in inquiring professors about their work, and looking into [CURF](https://www.curf.upenn.edu/research) and department-specific research grants.\\n\\n---\\n#####<h4 style=color:#2661c3>Final Thoughts\\nThis concludes our analysis of freshmen summers from upperclassmen insights. By democratizing this information, we aim to encourage future generations of Penn students to pursue more fulfilling and unique opportunities both in their summers and in post-grad ventures. Most importantly, we recognize the increasing pre-professional pressure caused by the ubiquity of students in suits around campus during the first few months of OCR. Freshman year is for making lifelong friends, developing stronger identities, and taking full advantage of being immersed in a youthful community of changemakers. \\n\\n**==From all of the writers at The Sign.al, we implore future Quakers to take these words to heart, calm down, and just enjoy the ride.==**\\n\\n---\\n######<h6 style=color:#2661c3>Want to know *everything* from our upperclassmen?\\n\\nWe weren’t kidding when we said we would democratize everything.

The fields with the\nhighest conversion rates are:\n\n * Tech and Startups - 60%\n * Financial Services - 53%\n * Marketing & Analytics - 25%\n\n*General business internships was split into financial services and marketing &\nanalytics for more accurate insights\n\nThe pathways chart below shows many of the pivots our participants made from\nfreshmen summer to now:\n\n\n\nDespite this, one trend that was apparent in the data was the connection between\noverall summer satisfaction and major pursued.\n\nParticipants were split evenly between those whose internship role matched with\ntheir current major and those whose did not. Those whose matched had a\nsignificantly higher usefulness score of 7.1 out of 10, compared to only 4.3 out\nof 10 for those whose did not. It is important to note that we did not collect\ndata on changes in major before and after freshman summer. Thus, it is unclear\nif freshman summer experiences caused better alignment of major preference or\ninitial major preferences caused a better summer experience.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummer Search Timeline\n\nLastly, we collected data on start and end dates of each participant’s search\nfor summer plans. The average time spent searching was 2.5 months, with the\naverage participant starting in early February and finishing in mid-April.\n\nThese dates varied across the different summer types:\n\nSummer Plans Search Timeline\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n 1. When analyzing correlations between timelines and summer perceptions, there\n    was no change in average usefulness scores regardless of the length of time\n    spent searching for plans. Thus, searching for longer does not necessarily\n    result in a “higher quality” summer.\n\n 2. Students who traveled or studied abroad both started and finished the\n    earliest. Such programs typically close applications in early spring; thus\n    we recommend freshmen who are pursuing these plans to prepare early.\n 3. Students who conducted research or took classes on campus had the shortest\n    search timeline. These students recommend being proactive in inquiring\n    professors about their work, and looking into CURF\n    [https://www.curf.upenn.edu/research]  and department-specific research\n    grants.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis concludes our analysis of freshmen summers from upperclassmen insights. By\ndemocratizing this information, we aim to encourage future generations of Penn\nstudents to pursue more fulfilling and unique opportunities both in their\nsummers and in post-grad ventures. Most importantly, we recognize the increasing\npre-professional pressure caused by the ubiquity of students in suits around\ncampus during the first few months of OCR. Freshman year is for making lifelong\nfriends, developing stronger identities, and taking full advantage of being\nimmersed in a youthful community of changemakers.\n\nFrom all of the writers at The Sign.al [http://Sign.al], we implore future\nQuakers to take these words to heart, calm down, and just enjoy the ride.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant to know everything  from our upperclassmen?\nWe weren’t kidding when we said we would democratize everything.

Be knights, adventurers, and explorers — go out and tackle something really hard and scary with your best friends.\\n2. If you’re smart, hardworking, and lucky enough to go to a great school — your downside is incredibly limited, especially when you’re young. Take risks, be an entrepreneur.\\n3. Universities are a great places to explore, to meet people, and to really go deep into intellectual fields — but don’t forget to bridge the gap to industry.\\n\\n---\\nEdward is an angel investor in over 40 companies, managing partner at Horizons Alpha, cofounder of Horizons School of Technology along with Abhi Ramesh and Darwish Gani, and a cofounder of Y Combinator-backed GovPredict. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 2014. \\n\\n*Editor: In the winter of my freshman year I crossed paths with Edward. I became enamored with his clear vision for a school called Horizons — an institution built for the 21st century. He burst with an entrepreneurial passion and curiosity that made me want to meet likeminded Penn alumni. Edward’s cofounder at GovPredict describes him best: “The ambition of Alexander the Great with the touch of Midas. Blessed with a personal magnetism, Edward is an unstoppable force as a cofounder and a visionary investor. I expect, not long from now, for him to be known as the best of our generation.”*\\n\\n--------\\n\\n###### Tell me about your path to becoming an entrepreneur.\\n\\nBack in high school I had a cashmere scarf company. You hear about people who had lemonade stands when they were ten but that wasn’t necessarily the case for me. I think I was a little bit more shy in middle school and high school and then I went to a more American school. \\n\\nOriginally, I grew up in Paris, France, where classes go from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. Then I went to an American high school that had more clubs and activities which helped me become a little bit more entrepreneurial. It got interesting when I arrived at Penn. Freshman year, we’re 18, and all I can say is, “Wow, all of the world’s possibilities are open”, and two weeks into college I see people going to Goldman Sachs info sessions. And I have nothing against Goldman Sachs, but what I’m saying is if you’re 18 and you’re a week or two into college should you really be attending investment banking info sessions? That was a big surprise to me. I saw a lot of friends who had artistic interests and who gave it up because saying, “It’s not useful” or “I can’t make money doing that.” \\n\\nSo my very first web application was a site called Famocracy where people could post things as five different categories — photographers, musicians, designers, models, and movie makers — where they could get upvoted and be able to win auditions and jobs. That was my first online thing  —  it was a response to the fact that so many creative people were choosing one track so early on instead of keeping the flame alive for whatever passion they had. I built that when I couldn’t code, and it was quite frustrating. I didn’t feel like I controlled the product. After that experience I knew that I needed to learn how to code to make my own minimum viable product.\\n\\nIn terms of how I got started building stuff, I knew a couple good friends that were programmers and I sat down with them in Huntsman Hall and told them, “I want to build my first website can you help me with this.” They would sit next to me and eventually I started feeling more comfortable. \\n> ==The key is to build the stuff with friends, sometimes even during the winter I would walk down to Towne from 40th Street because I didn’t want to do the homework alone and knew it was better to struggle with friends. It’s easier to feel way more confident when you’re sitting at a computer with someone else. I think in math and computer science confidence is essential. You have to believe you can solve the problem in order to even have a shot.==\\n\\n\\n###### You’re also an active angel investor. How did you get started with that and what do you look for in your investments?\\n\\nI realized that I was already talking with several founders every day for fun, because I was excited to learn about what they were doing and wanted see if I could help. That I was already doing a big part of the job. I love investing because I’m very curious and want to be involved with all the great projects out there. You can only really start one company at a time but you can be involved with dozens of others, not necessarily working on them every day but making yourself useful whenever the founders need you. You end up learning a lot about being a founder in general and about extremely different spaces. It’s an amazing way to keep learning.\\n\\nI invest early and 80 percent of my decision is based on the founders. There’s a big intangible part to this but I think you feel it when you see it, those founders who are truly competent, relentlessly intense, inevitable, and who could not be doing anything else. They’re not convincing you of anything, just explaining it.\\n\\nThe other 20 percent is whether I understand the idea and think it’s a good one, and again whether I think the team will be able to adapt quickly enough if the idea is slightly off. It most likely will be and it’s all about whether they’ll be able to morph successfully time after time until they find fit. And they have to care enough about the space to make it that far.\\n\\n\\n###### Did you take the introductory computer science classes at Penn?\\n\\nSo I skipped 110 (Introduction to Programming) and took 120 (Programming Languages and Techniques I)  and 121 (Programming Languages and Techniques II: Data Structures and Algorithms). I think 120 and 121 were both really interesting, they were essentially math problems you solved with lines of code. But again, 120 doesn’t teach you how to build a web or mobile app. That you still have to pick up on your own, which is both fine and not fine. It’s great you’re able to explore and be challenged by 120 and 121, but aren’t you also supposed to be prepared for what you’ll be doing after school?\\n\\n###### So do you believe there’s merit to the challenge raised by more theoretical, head-wrenching approaches to computer science while still in school?\\n\\nProbably. I don’t know. I don’t actually know what effect it has on people’s minds to be solving difficult problems like that. I wonder if people become a little bit less sharp once they leave school and once they do more repetitive day to day work and aren’t constantly faced with these difficult problems. I think there is some sort of merit, but maybe the most value added is for those people that have tremendous curiosity about the field. I have friends that were very, very good at 121 and 320 and won competitions for optimization and you could tell that they loved it, and others who didn’t enjoy it as much. But maybe those that didn’t enjoy it as much would make incredible front end designers.\\n\\n######The goal of many computer science courses is to develop algorithmic thinking in students. The argument being that algorithmic thinking applies across disciplines  —  what do you think about that argument?\\n\\nThe actual thing that applies across disciplines, and if you ask me is that the most useful thing you can do, is to read a lot of good fiction. I love reading great books and I find that great books allow you to live a full life, in a very sort of condensed way. They’re the most condensed form of life, if you know what I mean. And if you just ingest a lot of good ones you sort of become wise beyond your years.\\n\\nYou have 18-year-old kids that have read all the great novels and they empathize with these characters and are in tune with very subtle feelings and that cannot be conveyed without the story, without the experience. If you’re talking about stuff that’s useful across disciplines I think that fiction and novels is more useful. But back to computer science, I think that 120 and 121 are very useful if you’re going to be a software engineer that’s going to be working on backend stuff. Even as a web developer, we sometimes think of run times and things like that. The value of 120 is that it throws a lot of work at you and teaches you how to suffer through problems. It gets you thinking about being efficient, and I think that has merit.\\n\\n\\n###### So what kind of jobs do you recommend students interested in technology should get and how do you approach the issue at Horizons?\\n\\nWe have a few different tracks that we implement into the Horizons curriculum. We attract a bunch of different people with a bunch of different goals. Some of them might want to become software engineers. There is a PM track for those that know they want to be a product manager. There’s also an entrepreneur track — for those that want to build a MVP. It’s almost sort of entrepreneurial coding, Abhi, Darwish, and I are all technical but I wouldn’t say that we are great coders by any means. My code gets messy, it’s not all pretty and commented everywhere, we code to get it done, that’s our approach and our philosophy. We get a lot of interest from MBAs who say they already have a product they want to work on. Others say, “I already have my job offer in consulting but I don’t want to be limited by my skillet down the road.” \\n\\nA big part of the program is helping our students figure out what their interests are. It’s crazy when you hear people talking about their careers and they go, “Should I do finance at Goldman Sachs or should I do tech at Google”, and those are the only options that exist in their mind. What we’re actually working on and releasing soon is our jobs database, where we find really interesting and fast growing technology companies that very few people have heard of but that have raised 50 or 200 million dollars. There are hundreds of them and they’re often more interesting than the Googles or Facebooks because you get to be on a smaller team and grow faster. We want our students to work at places that are in line with their interests and their personalities, what would be a good fit for them, and then bring a lot of people from these companies into our program as speakers.\\n\\n\\n###### What was your first job?\\n\\nSophomore year I interned with StartX, that was the year I taught myself how to code. I wasn’t that good but I wanted find a creative opportunity that not a lot of people would go for, and be exposed to startups. I got to work on the team of StartX building tools for their companies and I just loved being able to see all of them in one place. Junior year I had another coding internship at a company in San Francisco that I perhaps shouldn’t name because two days in I told them I was going to quit and write my novel that summer. \\n\\nSo I wrote 200 pages of a novel that summer. I had this zoomed out perspective on life where I thought, “What other moment in my life am I going to have a free summer while I’m still in school and the consequences aren’t that bad.” And I’d always been interested in writing. I thought, I could always do this later, the real world will come and so I just got up in San Francisco every day at 5:00 am wrote for six or seven hours and spent the rest of my days with my friends just living more adventures that I could write about the next day. I did that and then got a little bit bored and sort of lonely after a month and a half, so I started working on another project with Abhi and our friend Vinny, which was another tool to allow people to sell stuff on Facebook then worked on a bunch of other things.\\n\\nMy first job out of college was working on a company I started  —  GovPredict. My close friend Emil and I got into Y Combinator, a startup accelerator program, and moved out to Palo Alto for the summer and worked on it, I’ve worked on a bunch of projects since and Horizons is the newest and most ambitious one.\\n\\n###### You probably have a lot of friends who decided not to pursue entrepreneurship. Why did you go to YC after college, and work on side projects with no sense of security?\\n\\n[Abhi Ramesh](http://thesign.al/abhi-ramesh-cofounder-at-horizons-school-of-technology/) and I talk about this all the time. We had a great time at Penn. On the other hand, you could view your university education, as far as an entrepreneur, as a disadvantage in many ways. A lot of people graduate and have a very high perceived opportunity cost. Everyone thinks, “Well I could be making $140,000 or $150,000 at Goldman Sachs my first year”, which makes entrepreneurship seem to be a much riskier option, but actually what I think a lot of people think the risk is much higher than it is. If you’re smart, hardworking, and lucky enough to go to a great school  —  your downside is incredibly limited, especially when you’re young. It’s very unlikely you’ll be in a position with no options — we have a bunch of unfair advantages  —  but the upside is infinite as an entrepreneur.\\n\\nAbhi recently quit his job. And what happens in the worst case to people who don’t have a job, but know how to code and who are smart and well connected? You can almost always find other professional opportunities, so you might as well give it a shot.\\n\\nI also think from an existential point of view, there is already infinite risk to being alive. Everyone grows old and dies, that’s the human condition, it’s very difficult. You know what the outcome of life is going to be, you might as well do crazy stuff. Why not.\\n\\n###### It sounds like you love to work with your friends on projects. What do you think about friends as co-founders?\\n\\nI think that the best part about entrepreneurship is that you get to work with your friends. It’s like the modern version of being knights, adventurers, or explorers  —  going out and tackling something really hard and scary but in it together. I think friendship is a huge part of entrepreneurship. My best friends have often been my cofounders, and I think that’s a great thing. It’s always risky because everything can go wrong at once, the company, the friendship. But you have to be willing to accept that risk. \\n> ==I think friendship is the best part of entrepreneurship. When you’re working on your own thing, it’s difficult and scary all the time. You think of giving up pretty often, but when you care about the people that you work with, you don’t give up. You owe it to them to be strong and to keep working. Work is one of the most meaningful parts of your life, what else could link you so strongly to someone than spending so much of your time with them?==\\n\\n--------\\n\\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

He burst with an entrepreneurial passion and curiosity that made me want to meet likeminded Penn alumni. Edward’s cofounder at GovPredict describes him best: “The ambition of Alexander the Great with the touch of Midas. Blessed with a personal magnetism, Edward is an unstoppable force as a cofounder and a visionary investor. I expect, not long from now, for him to be known as the best of our generation.”</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h6 id=\"tellmeaboutyourpathtobecominganentrepreneur\">Tell me about your path to becoming an entrepreneur.</h6>\n<p>Back in high school I had a cashmere scarf company. You hear about people who had lemonade stands when they were ten but that wasn’t necessarily the case for me. I think I was a little bit more shy in middle school and high school and then I went to a more American school.</p>\n<p>Originally, I grew up in Paris, France, where classes go from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. Then I went to an American high school that had more clubs and activities which helped me become a little bit more entrepreneurial. It got interesting when I arrived at Penn. Freshman year, we’re 18, and all I can say is, “Wow, all of the world’s possibilities are open”, and two weeks into college I see people going to Goldman Sachs info sessions. And I have nothing against Goldman Sachs, but what I’m saying is if you’re 18 and you’re a week or two into college should you really be attending investment banking info sessions? That was a big surprise to me. I saw a lot of friends who had artistic interests and who gave it up because saying, “It’s not useful” or “I can’t make money doing that.”</p>\n<p>So my very first web application was a site called Famocracy where people could post things as five different categories — photographers, musicians, designers, models, and movie makers — where they could get upvoted and be able to win auditions and jobs. That was my first online thing  —  it was a response to the fact that so many creative people were choosing one track so early on instead of keeping the flame alive for whatever passion they had. I built that when I couldn’t code, and it was quite frustrating. I didn’t feel like I controlled the product. After that experience I knew that I needed to learn how to code to make my own minimum viable product.</p>\n<p>In terms of how I got started building stuff, I knew a couple good friends that were programmers and I sat down with them in Huntsman Hall and told them, “I want to build my first website can you help me with this.” They would sit next to me and eventually I started feeling more comfortable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>The key is to build the stuff with friends, sometimes even during the winter I would walk down to Towne from 40th Street because I didn’t want to do the homework alone and knew it was better to struggle with friends. It’s easier to feel way more confident when you’re sitting at a computer with someone else. I think in math and computer science confidence is essential. You have to believe you can solve the problem in order to even have a shot.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h6 id=\"yourealsoanactiveangelinvestorhowdidyougetstartedwiththatandwhatdoyoulookforinyourinvestments\">You’re also an active angel investor. How did you get started with that and what do you look for in your investments?</h6>\n<p>I realized that I was already talking with several founders every day for fun, because I was excited to learn about what they were doing and wanted see if I could help. That I was already doing a big part of the job. I love investing because I’m very curious and want to be involved with all the great projects out there. You can only really start one company at a time but you can be involved with dozens of others, not necessarily working on them every day but making yourself useful whenever the founders need you. You end up learning a lot about being a founder in general and about extremely different spaces. It’s an amazing way to keep learning.</p>\n<p>I invest early and 80 percent of my decision is based on the founders. There’s a big intangible part to this but I think you feel it when you see it, those founders who are truly competent, relentlessly intense, inevitable, and who could not be doing anything else. They’re not convincing you of anything, just explaining it.</p>\n<p>The other 20 percent is whether I understand the idea and think it’s a good one, and again whether I think the team will be able to adapt quickly enough if the idea is slightly off. It most likely will be and it’s all about whether they’ll be able to morph successfully time after time until they find fit. And they have to care enough about the space to make it that far.</p>\n<h6 id=\"didyoutaketheintroductorycomputerscienceclassesatpenn\">Did you take the introductory computer science classes at Penn?</h6>\n<p>So I skipped 110 (Introduction to Programming) and took 120 (Programming Languages and Techniques I)  and 121 (Programming Languages and Techniques II: Data Structures and Algorithms). I think 120 and 121 were both really interesting, they were essentially math problems you solved with lines of code. But again, 120 doesn’t teach you how to build a web or mobile app. That you still have to pick up on your own, which is both fine and not fine. It’s great you’re able to explore and be challenged by 120 and 121, but aren’t you also supposed to be prepared for what you’ll be doing after school?</p>\n<h6 id=\"sodoyoubelievetheresmerittothechallengeraisedbymoretheoreticalheadwrenchingapproachestocomputersciencewhilestillinschool\">So do you believe there’s merit to the challenge raised by more theoretical, head-wrenching approaches to computer science while still in school?</h6>\n<p>Probably. I don’t know. I don’t actually know what effect it has on people’s minds to be solving difficult problems like that. I wonder if people become a little bit less sharp once they leave school and once they do more repetitive day to day work and aren’t constantly faced with these difficult problems. I think there is some sort of merit, but maybe the most value added is for those people that have tremendous curiosity about the field. I have friends that were very, very good at 121 and 320 and won competitions for optimization and you could tell that they loved it, and others who didn’t enjoy it as much. But maybe those that didn’t enjoy it as much would make incredible front end designers.</p>\n<h6 id=\"thegoalofmanycomputersciencecoursesistodevelopalgorithmicthinkinginstudentstheargumentbeingthatalgorithmicthinkingappliesacrossdisciplineswhatdoyouthinkaboutthatargument\">The goal of many computer science courses is to develop algorithmic thinking in students. The argument being that algorithmic thinking applies across disciplines  —  what do you think about that argument?</h6>\n<p>The actual thing that applies across disciplines, and if you ask me is that the most useful thing you can do, is to read a lot of good fiction. I love reading great books and I find that great books allow you to live a full life, in a very sort of condensed way. They’re the most condensed form of life, if you know what I mean. And if you just ingest a lot of good ones you sort of become wise beyond your years.</p>\n<p>You have 18-year-old kids that have read all the great novels and they empathize with these characters and are in tune with very subtle feelings and that cannot be conveyed without the story, without the experience. If you’re talking about stuff that’s useful across disciplines I think that fiction and novels is more useful. But back to computer science, I think that 120 and 121 are very useful if you’re going to be a software engineer that’s going to be working on backend stuff. Even as a web developer, we sometimes think of run times and things like that. The value of 120 is that it throws a lot of work at you and teaches you how to suffer through problems. It gets you thinking about being efficient, and I think that has merit.</p>\n<h6 id=\"sowhatkindofjobsdoyourecommendstudentsinterestedintechnologyshouldgetandhowdoyouapproachtheissueathorizons\">So what kind of jobs do you recommend students interested in technology should get and how do you approach the issue at Horizons?</h6>\n<p>We have a few different tracks that we implement into the Horizons curriculum. We attract a bunch of different people with a bunch of different goals. Some of them might want to become software engineers. There is a PM track for those that know they want to be a product manager. There’s also an entrepreneur track — for those that want to build a MVP. It’s almost sort of entrepreneurial coding, Abhi, Darwish, and I are all technical but I wouldn’t say that we are great coders by any means. My code gets messy, it’s not all pretty and commented everywhere, we code to get it done, that’s our approach and our philosophy. We get a lot of interest from MBAs who say they already have a product they want to work on. Others say, “I already have my job offer in consulting but I don’t want to be limited by my skillet down the road.”</p>\n<p>A big part of the program is helping our students figure out what their interests are. It’s crazy when you hear people talking about their careers and they go, “Should I do finance at Goldman Sachs or should I do tech at Google”, and those are the only options that exist in their mind. What we’re actually working on and releasing soon is our jobs database, where we find really interesting and fast growing technology companies that very few people have heard of but that have raised 50 or 200 million dollars. There are hundreds of them and they’re often more interesting than the Googles or Facebooks because you get to be on a smaller team and grow faster. We want our students to work at places that are in line with their interests and their personalities, what would be a good fit for them, and then bring a lot of people from these companies into our program as speakers.</p>\n<h6 id=\"whatwasyourfirstjob\">What was your first job?</h6>\n<p>Sophomore year I interned with StartX, that was the year I taught myself how to code. I wasn’t that good but I wanted find a creative opportunity that not a lot of people would go for, and be exposed to startups. I got to work on the team of StartX building tools for their companies and I just loved being able to see all of them in one place. Junior year I had another coding internship at a company in San Francisco that I perhaps shouldn’t name because two days in I told them I was going to quit and write my novel that summer.</p>\n<p>So I wrote 200 pages of a novel that summer. I had this zoomed out perspective on life where I thought, “What other moment in my life am I going to have a free summer while I’m still in school and the consequences aren’t that bad.” And I’d always been interested in writing. I thought, I could always do this later, the real world will come and so I just got up in San Francisco every day at 5:00 am wrote for six or seven hours and spent the rest of my days with my friends just living more adventures that I could write about the next day. I did that and then got a little bit bored and sort of lonely after a month and a half, so I started working on another project with Abhi and our friend Vinny, which was another tool to allow people to sell stuff on Facebook then worked on a bunch of other things.</p>\n<p>My first job out of college was working on a company I started  —  GovPredict. My close friend Emil and I got into Y Combinator, a startup accelerator program, and moved out to Palo Alto for the summer and worked on it, I’ve worked on a bunch of projects since and Horizons is the newest and most ambitious one.</p>\n<h6 id=\"youprobablyhavealotoffriendswhodecidednottopursueentrepreneurshipwhydidyougotoycaftercollegeandworkonsideprojectswithnosenseofsecurity\">You probably have a lot of friends who decided not to pursue entrepreneurship. Why did you go to YC after college, and work on side projects with no sense of security?</h6>\n<p><a href=\"http://thesign.al/abhi-ramesh-cofounder-at-horizons-school-of-technology/\">Abhi Ramesh</a> and I talk about this all the time. We had a great time at Penn. On the other hand, you could view your university education, as far as an entrepreneur, as a disadvantage in many ways. A lot of people graduate and have a very high perceived opportunity cost. Everyone thinks, “Well I could be making $140,000 or $150,000 at Goldman Sachs my first year”, which makes entrepreneurship seem to be a much riskier option, but actually what I think a lot of people think the risk is much higher than it is. If you’re smart, hardworking, and lucky enough to go to a great school  —  your downside is incredibly limited, especially when you’re young. It’s very unlikely you’ll be in a position with no options — we have a bunch of unfair advantages  —  but the upside is infinite as an entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>Abhi recently quit his job. And what happens in the worst case to people who don’t have a job, but know how to code and who are smart and well connected? You can almost always find other professional opportunities, so you might as well give it a shot.</p>\n<p>I also think from an existential point of view, there is already infinite risk to being alive. Everyone grows old and dies, that’s the human condition, it’s very difficult. You know what the outcome of life is going to be, you might as well do crazy stuff. Why not.</p>\n<h6 id=\"itsoundslikeyoulovetoworkwithyourfriendsonprojectswhatdoyouthinkaboutfriendsascofounders\">It sounds like you love to work with your friends on projects. What do you think about friends as co-founders?</h6>\n<p>I think that the best part about entrepreneurship is that you get to work with your friends. It’s like the modern version of being knights, adventurers, or explorers  —  going out and tackling something really hard and scary but in it together. I think friendship is a huge part of entrepreneurship. My best friends have often been my cofounders, and I think that’s a great thing. It’s always risky because everything can go wrong at once, the company, the friendship. But you have to be willing to accept that risk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>I think friendship is the best part of entrepreneurship. When you’re working on your own thing, it’s difficult and scary all the time. You think of giving up pretty often, but when you care about the people that you work with, you don’t give up. You owe it to them to be strong and to keep working. Work is one of the most meaningful parts of your life, what else could link you so strongly to someone than spending so much of your time with them?</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

How did you recruit for it?\\n\\nWhen I was an undergrad studying Aerospace Engineering, I took part in quite a few projects that involved dealing with actual space hardware. This included helping build a small satellite that was actually deployed in space. After that, I spent some time teaching physics and chemistry, but then went back to grad school for a Masters in Systems Engineering at Penn. While at Penn, I continued working on aerospace related projects by joining the Penn Aerospace Club and was a project lead for the High Altitude Balloon Team. \\n\\nI always wanted the opportunity to work at a leading edge tech company, so when the recruiters came to the school for a presentation, I had to go meet them. After the presentation ended, I stayed for a while and spoke with each of the presenters about my background. This led to my resume getting recommended internally and subsequently, to my interview.\\n\\n\\n######  Why did you choose SpaceX, and why did you want to go into the NewSpace industry?\\n*Editor's note: The NewSpace industry is a result of the recent trend of privatization in the space industry by startups.*\\n\\nLike most space geeks, I grew up learning about the monumental achievements of NASA over the last fifty years. From the race to the moon, to the Shuttle Program, and finally to maintaining the International Space Station. The technical achievement was enormous, but at the same time, in more recent years, I have begun thinking about how while NASA can still achieve so much, the space industry as a whole is hindered by the fact that so much of our advancement here in the United States hinges on one major entity. Wherever NASA goes, space goes. \\n\\nWhile at UT Austin, I attended a presentation by Burt Rutan, not long after he completed his historic suborbital spaceflight to win the Ansari X Prize. Afterwards, I was invigorated to learn about what the private space industry can do. Thus began my interest in NewSpace, where a private company could potentially gather the resources and technical know-how to complete missions that up until now could only be completed by the leading nations of this planet.\\n\\n\\n###### What can current students look forward to in terms of changes the NewSpace industry will be facing in the next five years?\\n\\nIn the next five years this industry will be undergoing a revolution. In the realm of small satellites, \\\"cubesats\\\" are becoming a dominant force, both for small inexpensive orbital experiments as well as for commercial uses. Reusable launch vehicles are already being made as we speak, and once those technologies become more commonplace, the price to go to space will be reduced dramatically and allow the creation of a true space economy. The advent of cheaper and more powerful launch vehicles will allow for more complex and far reaching missions into deep space. \\n> ==From planetary landers, to planetary colonizers, to interstellar probes, science and humans will be reaching out and literally touching every part of this solar system in the future.==\\n\\nIn the next five years there will be manned missions to other celestial bodies being planned. It is an exciting time to be a part of this industry and it will be a great time to learn and be a part of this revolution.\\n\\n\\n###### What soft and technical skills were most useful? Which of those have you developed while on the job?\\n\\nIt really depends on where you end up on the job, but most engineering type jobs look for demonstrated technical skills. You want to have shown through projects, in class, or in extracurricular activities, that you are able to work on a real engineering challenge. This may be via building a satellite, a racecar, or a software system. That's the easiest way to both demonstrate your knowledge, and also learn a lot about how to apply everything you've learned in class. \\n\\nI personally have to use soft skills a lot. I work with a lot of different people, both from a technical and non-technical respect. Having good soft skills allows you to communicate your ideas effectively to work better with a team. There aren't very many engineering positions where you are working by yourself. \\n> ==In today's world, every system is highly integrated and the technical must meet with both the design factors and human factors. The soft skills help bridge those gaps.==\\n\\n\\n###### What is the biggest motivating factor about working at SpaceX? \\n\\nThere is a really big sense of purpose where I work. We are working to change the industry and even the world. We have a very solid goal and everyone at the company understands that and pushes to achieve it. It is very rewarding to work so hard and actually be able to see the fruits of your labor take shape.\\n\\n\\n###### What is a reality about the job that students should be aware of before seriously considering it?\\n\\nThe reality is that interesting work is usually very hard work. Most students want to be a part of some new and exciting company, but along with that must come hard work. Accomplishing amazing things isn't easy and that's why it's amazing. That being said, nothing is too hard and in my opinion, the harder the task the greater the reward.\\n\\n\\n###### What would you recommend to young Penn students who are looking into a career like this? \\n\\nMy biggest recommendation is to get involved with some kind of project. Projects give you the experience you need. It is very important to take a large role in a project and truly contribute to its completion. It makes the transition from school to work much easier, and it also makes interviews a breeze because you have so much to talk about. \\n> ==Find a project you're passionate about and just pursue it whole-heartedly.==\\n\\nThere are so many student-run projects at Penn that it's hard to name just one, but I really advise to join one where you can get your hands dirty. \\n\\nAs for exploration outside of Penn, I would just keep an ear open for any conferences, talks, or meetings that have anything to do with what you are interested in. Go to as many as you can and talk to as many people as you can. Any one of them could be the lead you need to get that awesome job. Even those conversations that don't lead to anything meaningful are great practice sessions for your interview and soft skills.\\n\\n --------\\n\\n*Disclaimers:  The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

I wasn't that far off from the DNA that matriculating Wharton students have, working in fields like finance or engineering or consulting. I got to Wharton and I think I could have carried on in financial services, and certainly with all the companies that populate Career Services it was really easy to do that.

Far too often, students fail to take advantage of these testing grounds. Below are key tips for getting the most out of the experience. \\n\\n---\\n<h4>Exercise the power of writing.</h4>\\n \\nFirst, take a few moments and write – publicly or privately – about your current mindset: Why are you doing this particular internship? What are you hoping to learn? What skills or previous experience are you going to leverage? Documenting these informal expectations will help you stay on track, especially when the workload picks up. \\n\\nCreate a few checkpoint dates for yourself throughout your internship to reflect or change these goals. Then, write some more. What is different from what you expected? Are you reaching your goal? Whenever times get rough, you can look back at these for motivation.\\n \\n<h4>People are walking libraries.</h4>\\n \\nNo matter what company you're at – S&P 500 giant or startup – around every corner desk sits someone itching to tell another bug-eyed youngster his or her story. I've accumulated lessons from Survivor contestants, nuclear power plant managers, and full-time mom-preneurs.\\n \\nUse your lunchtimes and coffee breaks wisely. Ask to eat with your mentor and his or her friends, or to connect you with another team of interest. As the new intern, you're analogous to the starving kid walking among countless rows of sampling tables at Costco. Brandish your suit of bravery and ask for a share - but don't be that annoying customer that buys nothing. It is *infinitely* more memorable if, prior to meeting coworkers, you’ve prepared well-composed research on them and their projects. Bonus points if you can make recommendations or offer help.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/HOmhNia.png\\n\\\" alt=\\\"If Internet Explorer is brave enough to ask you to be your default browser, you're brave enough to ask that girl out.\\\" style=\\\"width:50%;height:50%\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Image source: Reddit.com.</p>*\\n \\nDuring such chats, learn about the interesting people they have worked with at the firm. If they are of interest, ask for an introduction and remind them during the follow-up \\\"Thank You\\\" email. If you forget to send the email, it's better late than never. Doing so will remind them of your enthusiasm, especially if you recall a memorable part of the conversation.\\n \\n<h4>Don't be invisible.</h4>\\n \\nThe worst thing that can happen to interns is to be forgotten by their team as to why they were there this summer. Don't stop asking questions, asking for more work, and making yourself known. After all, companies rarely need interns to do their work. The purpose is 95% to capture younger talent for full-time and 5% for coffee runs.\\n \\nAnd if coffee runs are all you're tasked to do, **be the best coffee runner in the world**. \\n \\n<img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/yiTMGgO.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Zootopia\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Image source: Zootopia</p>*\\n\\nA fellow intern once kept a bowl of candy on her desk. She would make it a daily routine to ask passerbys who take a piece about their day. She soon became one of the most well-liked interns. \\n\\nAnother intern took the initiative to buy donuts for his team on days he knew were going to be rough. On hiring day, teams usually consider the intern's likability and quality of work alike. Small gestures like these can add up.\\n<h4>Be a Learn-it-all, not a Know-it-all.</h4>\\n \\nLearn-it-alls > Know-it-alls any day. A company has no place for a self-proclaimed genius. As stated in Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, be curious and others will open up to you. The [Ben Franklin effect](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ben_Franklin_effect) shows that people build camaraderie and trust after giving advice more so than receiving it. Absorb everything at first, and then return the gesture once you've proven yourself.\\n \\n<h4>Take criticism. Be a big kid.</h4>\\n \\nOne of the biggest pieces of advice I've gotten is to treat your manager as a coach, not a grader. Don't take criticism personally, but rather as another perspective of your work. Every scathing review or outburst is another learning opportunity. That being said, if the reviews do cross the line, consult your mentor for an outside opinion. \\n \\n<img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/tuF6Ekf.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Savage Chickens\\\" style=\\\"width:60%;height:60%\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Image source: Doug Savage</p>*\\n\\n<h4>The most welcoming group is often your school network.</h4>\\n \\nReach out to alumni who work at your company through LinkedIn or your school's alumni database (e.g. [Quakernet](https://quakernet-idp.alumni.upenn.edu/discovery/?entityID=https://quakernet-idp.alumni.upenn.edu/sp&return=https://quakernet-idp.alumni.upenn.edu/Shibboleth.sso/Login?SAMLDS=1&target=ss%253Amem%253Ace1c8bacd3846e21c8603f44cf3270fa9a084f9a63570ea11da433cbb85e55ae)).

Far too often, students fail to take advantage of these testing grounds. Below are key tips for getting the most out of the experience.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Exercise the power of writing.</h4>\n<p>First, take a few moments and write – publicly or privately – about your current mindset: Why are you doing this particular internship? What are you hoping to learn? What skills or previous experience are you going to leverage? Documenting these informal expectations will help you stay on track, especially when the workload picks up.</p>\n<p>Create a few checkpoint dates for yourself throughout your internship to reflect or change these goals. Then, write some more. What is different from what you expected? Are you reaching your goal? Whenever times get rough, you can look back at these for motivation.</p>\n<h4>People are walking libraries.</h4>\n<p>No matter what company you're at – S&amp;P 500 giant or startup – around every corner desk sits someone itching to tell another bug-eyed youngster his or her story. I've accumulated lessons from Survivor contestants, nuclear power plant managers, and full-time mom-preneurs.</p>\n<p>Use your lunchtimes and coffee breaks wisely. Ask to eat with your mentor and his or her friends, or to connect you with another team of interest. As the new intern, you're analogous to the starving kid walking among countless rows of sampling tables at Costco. Brandish your suit of bravery and ask for a share - but don't be that annoying customer that buys nothing. It is <em>infinitely</em> more memorable if, prior to meeting coworkers, you’ve prepared well-composed research on them and their projects. Bonus points if you can make recommendations or offer help.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HOmhNia.png\n\" alt=\"If Internet Explorer is brave enough to ask you to be your default browser, you're brave enough to ask that girl out.\" style=\"width:50%;height:50%\"><em><p align=\"center\">Image source: <a href=\"http://Reddit.com\">Reddit.com</a>.</p></em></p>\n<p>During such chats, learn about the interesting people they have worked with at the firm. If they are of interest, ask for an introduction and remind them during the follow-up &quot;Thank You&quot; email. If you forget to send the email, it's better late than never. Doing so will remind them of your enthusiasm, especially if you recall a memorable part of the conversation.</p>\n<h4>Don't be invisible.</h4>\n<p>The worst thing that can happen to interns is to be forgotten by their team as to why they were there this summer. Don't stop asking questions, asking for more work, and making yourself known. After all, companies rarely need interns to do their work. The purpose is 95% to capture younger talent for full-time and 5% for coffee runs.</p>\n<p>And if coffee runs are all you're tasked to do, <strong>be the best coffee runner in the world</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yiTMGgO.gif\" alt=\"Zootopia\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%\"><em><p align=\"center\">Image source: Zootopia</p></em></p>\n<p>A fellow intern once kept a bowl of candy on her desk.

On hiring day, teams usually consider the intern's likability and quality of work alike. Small gestures like these can add up.</p>\n<h4>Be a Learn-it-all, not a Know-it-all.</h4>\n<p>Learn-it-alls &gt; Know-it-alls any day. A company has no place for a self-proclaimed genius. As stated in Dale Carnegie's book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, be curious and others will open up to you. The <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ben_Franklin_effect\">Ben Franklin effect</a> shows that people build camaraderie and trust after giving advice more so than receiving it. Absorb everything at first, and then return the gesture once you've proven yourself.</p>\n<h4>Take criticism. Be a big kid.</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest pieces of advice I've gotten is to treat your manager as a coach, not a grader. Don't take criticism personally, but rather as another perspective of your work. Every scathing review or outburst is another learning opportunity.

It gets easier\nevery time after that.*\n\nThe more people are excited about it, the more the next person will be, \"Oh this\nmakes sense, since all these smart people are excited about it.\"\n\nYou just have to really believe in yourself and have a very articulate vision of\nwhat it could become. What looks a lot better is explaining, if everything goes\nright, what it could become five years. Focus on that end stage.\n\n**After Locality, what made you want to move on to Facebook?**Locality is a\nslightly profitable small business. I worked on it for five years. I got to the\npoint where I didn't have any good ideas for how I could take it to the next\nlevel. My cofounder is running it, and it's still making money. But, I decided\nthat I had done everything I could, and I just had to go. I decided to just get\nthe experience of working at a bigger company and see what it's like. So I'm\nhere.\n\nSo how do you like Facebook? Is there anything you didn't expect?\n\nI had never done structured product management in a bigger company, so I really\nwanted to see if anything I could learn here that would help me to become more\nrounded, to help me be better the next time I start something or go into another\nposition.\n\nI've learned a ton about how big companies operate. Overall, Facebook is an\nawesome place to work. Food's great, you get three meals a day, fun benefits,\nlike foosball tables, pool tables. It's basically the nicest college campus\never. As long as you focus on work, they'll take care of everything else.\n\nThe reason I wanted to be in a big company like Facebook was that I thought I\ndid a pretty good job in my last job, but how do I really know? I just want to\nsee: does it translate? What can I learn from a different style and in a\ndifferent environment?\n\nWhat do you read to increase your knowledge on the tech/entrepreneurial world?\n\nThere's an unbelievable amount of great content on the Internet for startups.\nEverything from Paul Graham [http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html], to a\nbunch of VC blogs — Marc Andreessen [https://twitter.com/pmarca]'s blog is\ngreat. You can replicate a lot of startup knowledge now just by reading a ton.\nThere are specific blogs and articles on marketing strategies, product\ndevelopment, how to recruit people. Just Google it and apply it to your own\nsituation.\n\nReading tech news is good. I read TechCrunch [www.techcrunch.com]  to find out\nFacebook’s new features actually (laughs). So yeah, TechCrunch, HackerNews\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/], stuff like that. In terms of generating ideas,\nyou want to pick a couple areas of interests and just go deeper, and look at\nmore research papers, essays, books. Pick a couple areas to specialize in and\nlearn more about. Hopefully, there are areas that you want to work in or start a\nbusiness in, in the future.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHeader photo courtesy of The Business of Fashion.","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/06/new_york_vs_london_1024-1.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Startups, London, Facebook: Jay Shek on Changing Up the Environment","meta_description":"Jay Shek pursued entrepreneurship & tech from San Francisco to London to NYC.

I thought I wanted to be a theoretical physicist or mathematician and try to solve the great mysteries of the universe. Once I got to college I kept that interest, but computer science was already a field and it was getting hotter in the mid-1990s. And then I realized that more than just understanding reality, you can start creating realities here. On the pragmatic side, you started to see stories of people founding these great companies and doing well. \\n\\nThat was my first career out of college — I worked at Oracle and then I worked at a finance-related startup called [meVC](http://https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/08/feat2.html). It was going to democratize venture capital and I was the CTO at the ripe age of 22 years old. It grew to 40 people and I was the first employee there — the founders were two bankers who hired me. And then the NASDAQ popped, and it became survival mode. That day, I thought maybe I should apply to business school. \\n\\nAt the time, my thinking about business school was that clearly something is happening to the world and the economy, and I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life. I had this tech thing, but I found it somewhat emotionally traumatic because everyday is like a roller coaster. One day you're daydreaming about your future stock wealth, another day you're wondering if you’ll ever be able to buy a house.\\n\\nSo I thought business school would allow me to think more about what I want to do. I always had an interest being a broader generalist, but my resume definitely was pigeonholing me into CTO-type positions.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ac0Kq3jSsp4/maxresdefault.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sal Khan Commencement Address\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Sal Khan delivering the Class Day address at Harvard Business School in 2014.</p>*\\n\\nI'd be lying if I didn't tell you part of my motivation was that I was very lonely and wanted a wife. I thought, school is a good place to meet people and figure out life. So I went to business school and I was exploring my options. I actually found the finance classes quite intriguing: it was this neat combination of math, economics, and human psychology. I got more and more interested in markets.\\n\\nThe second year, I took a capital markets class and my professor and I had a rapport. I asked him, “I really love this class, what can I do that is like this?” And he said, “You should go work at a hedge fund.” And I said, “That sounds great... what's a hedge fund?” If you ask someone what's a hedge fund, you will get many not-so-clear answers. \\n\\nI started asking around and I obviously had a lot of debt at that point so it looked like a really intriguing thing.\\n\\n\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div> \\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">I applied and probably got turned down from 40 different places. It was a horrible job market.</div>\\n\\nFor most of the people who want to go into hedge funds or private equity or these more selective financial careers, they have been building their resumes from the get go: they work at Goldman Sachs, and they get an internship at this private equity firm or this hedge fund. Mine looked nothing like that. I was getting a lot of inquiries from tech companies and even tech VC firms, but no one in the hedge fund world. But eventually there was this guy who was operating out of his house; his nascent hedge fund was starting to do well and he wanted to hire his first analyst. This was April of my second year when most of my peers had jobs already. I thought it'll at least get my foot in the door. \\n\\nI was lucky. Dan Wohl, my boss at Wohl Capital, was an incredible investor so I was able to learn a ton from him, not just on the financial or industry side, but also on how one should live their life. I was really enjoying that job, and I didn't view it as a temporary thing. When I was a year or two into it I was very happy and satisfied with where I was going, and based on Dan's investment acumen, we were doing well. But I had visions of one day starting a school. \\n\\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">In college, I got rejected for the Rhodes Scholarship twice. Both times I told them: I want to get a Ph.D. in education because I'm interested in ways to reform education. They clearly didn't view my application as credible.</div>\\n\\n Even in the hedge fund world, I thought, if I could do really well over the next 10–15 years, I could retire and start a school on my own terms. That was always in the back of my mind, but I definitely didn't expect to stay there for a short amount of time. \\n\\n**You have a very technical background in your undergrad as well as the hedge fund analyst role. Did you feel your technical foundation helped you when you were creating and growing Khan Academy as an organization?**\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"100\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982286&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\nYes and no. It's actually interesting that most people — based on my background and even stereotypes about Khan Academy — assume the analyst role must have been at a quantitative hedge fund, doing algorithmic trading. But it was actually the opposite: we were a qualitative hedge fund. I wanted to do that because while there was definitely a quantitative aspect to it in modeling an organization’s financials and making predictions, there was also a more human picture to it.\\n\\nMost of my day involved doing research on these companies, modeling and talking to their management teams to make sure I understood their business. Dan taught me to really listen closely and think about what is being said without it being said. Seeing when people are hesitant and what they choose to highlight, you can actually learn a lot about human psychology.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://bestreviewof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Khan.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sal Videos\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Sal making videos in the earlier days of the Academy.</p>*\\n\\nIn the Khan Academy world, in the early days I was making videos on math and science, so that's where my background helped a lot. I had an interest in those subjects and already had a strong view that most people weren't learning them in an intuitive way. Once Khan Academy started to get off the ground, I think the technical part was definitely important because for the early prototypes of the software on Khan Academy, I was coding stuff myself. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\nBut I also think the hedge fund background was important when it was time to decide what the structure of this organization should be. There were already VCs who were walking up and saying I'll write a check for this much right now, we could do a double bottom line organization and one day we can have some premium services, and this and that. But through my work in the hedge fund world I had become a student of capital structure. \\n\\n> <div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\"> I've seen that no matter what the founder thinks he or she wants, at the end of the day, it is the owners or the stakeholders in the economic future of the entity that are, in the long term, going to decide what the entity becomes. </div>\\n\\nI didn't want to undermine that trust that people had in Khan Academy, and I didn't want it to change even after I was dead. I still dream that it's going to be around 500 years from now. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n**How did you go about deciding to leave your job and pursue Khan Academy full-time?**\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"100\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982801&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\nIt's funny because I would always tell myself that I was relatively risk averse, but if you look at the arc of my career, even a two person hedge fund isn't most people's notions of stability. Compared to quitting my job, it was.\\n\\nI’ve thought a lot about this question when I was coming out of college and when I was thinking about doing Khan Academy full time. The more you put something out there and get evidence of strong product market fit and traction, and the more you can get that evidence while keeping your options open, the better. So if you are a Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates and you're in your dorm room in Harvard during sophomore year, you need a lot of evidence to convince yourself not just to leave a stable job, but to drop out of college. You shouldn't do that just from being inspired by some idea. Bill Gates had a contract with IBM, which was the tech company of the time, and Mark Zuckerberg clearly had this thing that was growing 10,000% a year with a lot of traction and no sign of stopping. So, if you hit on something like that, quit your job — you'd be nuts not to do it or at least to take some time off. \\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://media.glassdoor.com/l/452278/khan-academy-office.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Khan Academy office\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Khan Academy now has over a hundred employees at its Mountain View office.</p>*\\n\\nBut that's not going to be the norm. I would tell most people, including a younger version of myself, that it is good to go to a more established place right out of college. It insulates your resume just as going to a good college is something people will never take away from you. If early on in your career, you have a Google, a Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, or a Khan Academy on your resume, people will know it. They'll have heard of it and they’ll know those companies only hire certain people. They'll also think you probably learned something interesting at those firms that you can bring it to their firm.\\n\\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">The key is that if you do have an entrepreneurial desire long-term, don't let that atrophy.</div>\\n\\nOnce you're at five to six years in the industry, that's your first wave where you've learned a lot and it's not unreasonable to start thinking entrepreneurially. You're in your late 20s, you still don't have many mouths to feed and you kind of have a sense of how the world works. But even then, don't just do it on a whim.  Put something out there and prototype it. See if you can get some fit. \\n\\nI started tutoring my cousins in 2004, made videos in 2006, and I didn't quit my job until 2009 when there were already about 50,000 people who were using it. So it took me a while to make the plunge and even then it was super scary. There is a fun element to it: adventures are fun, but mostly in hindsight. When you don't know how it's going to end, it's incredibly stressful and scary. But one thing I did tell myself is that even if I have to go back to work in a traditional sense, I wasn't going to give up on this Khan Academy thing. So try to structure your endeavour in a way that it's kind of unkillable. \\n\\n**You mentioned that Dan Wohl was an important mentor for you. What are some of the key lessons that you learned from him in terms of your life principles and also from other important mentors that you had in your life?**\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"100\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982982&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\nI’ve had a lot of great mentors. My first boss at Oracle was [Thomas Kurian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kurian). He was a fairly young guy at the time; now he's the President of Product Development at Oracle. He was very clear in telling me not to get cynical.  It's very easy to get cynical, especially early in your life, and even more so coming out of college. You leave college very idealistic, you go to a big company and you start to wonder whether you matter. \\n\\n> <div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">Avoid becoming cynical yourself, and definitely avoid the cynical people. Because then it just turns into a death spiral of cynicism, and that's not going to help anybody.</div>\\n\\nNo matter what it seems like, wake up every morning and show up asking: what can I do today to make the most of this experience and to make it matter that I was there? Even when I was miserable in different kinds of jobs, when you take that attitude it becomes a challenge and it's more fun.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://blogs-images.forbes.com/oracle/files/2015/06/06_22_cloudlaunch_Kurian-.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Thomas Kurian\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Sal was one of Thomas Kurian's first direct reports when he started at Oracle.</p>*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"4\\\"></div>\\nThere's a bunch of stuff that I learned from Dan. I was ready to work 80 hours a week for him and he told me to go home. He said our job as investors is not to just work ourselves silly. That's just going impair our judgment. If you work too much on something you get so married to that idea that you're not going to know when to pull out of it.\\n\\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">Overprecision creates the illusion of artificial accuracy.</div>\\n\\nI even try to stress this in our own team when we're overanalyzing things. With overanalysis, you think you're mitigating risk, but you're actually increasing your risk by psychologically marrying yourself because you did so much analysis. Dan said our job is to make only a few really good decisions a year and to avoid making really bad decisions. And the best way you can do that is to have perspective, to be recharged. You can't define yourself by your job.\\n\\nI was working a solid 40 hours a week but those 40 hours were intense. If I didn't have that life outside of Wohl Capital, I wouldn't have been able to offer Nadia help. I wouldn't have had time to prototype software. So what I tell people is go learn your skills early in your career, find great mentors, work hard, learn a ton, and push yourself. Always ask questions. Ask for critical feedback and show that you can take it. But you should also leave some space for your passions and your interests, and that might blossom into something interesting. \\n\\n**Resources like Khan Academy provide individuals with more agency over their education than ever before. At the same time, people are getting more distracted by social media and push notifications. Where do you see Khan Academy’s role in keeping people engaged, and what advice do you have for dealing with today's distractions?**\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"100\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982943&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\n<div id=\\\"5\\\"></div>\\nI'll start with the latter. I think it's super important to be unplugged. For someone who works in technology, many people, including my wife, are often annoyed by how inaccessible I am via technology. \\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">I don't touch my phone over the weekend. I don't touch it after six o'clock. I actually barely look at it during the day.</div>\\n\\nAnd I think that's really important. It's not just becoming scatterbrained. You'll become unhappy if you are constantly rechecking your phone for the next dopamine rush, which is what most people are doing. And it is correlated with depression rates and anxiety.\\n\\nIn terms of Khan Academy's role, we want to make sure what we create is compelling and interesting, to create game mechanics and use the latest science out there to make it more engaging so that we can compete with all the distractions. But at the end of day, it's on the individual. It's an interesting dynamic because as you mentioned now with massive open online courses and Khan Academy, the knowledge is way more accessible. When I was 20 years old, if I really wanted to learn something on my own, I'd go to a library and get a pretty dense textbook and try to power through it. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. Now if you have that motivation, the tools make it way easier for you to do it. But then you have these competing sources of information.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"http://i.imgur.com/y39Hhy7.png\\\" alt=\\\"Khan Academy homepage\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Khan Academy uses design principles and interactivity to make its product more engaging for users.</p>*\\n\\nThe world is going to stay competitive, and I think the people who are able to have the discipline to quarantine or to compartmentalize around the distractions, to realize when they're okay and when they're unhealthy, and to dedicate efforts to bettering themselves with the many tools that exist — those are the people that are going to do better. \\n\\nYou're in a big game, and to win the game is to be a happy productive person — it isn’t to become rich or famous. And to become a happy productive person, you want to feel like you have a job that's creative or you have enough economic freedom that you can do the things you want in life without comparing yourself to others and constantly looking for that dopamine rush from your phone.\\n\\n**What advice do you have for people who are deciding between different career paths?**\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"100%\\\" height=\\\"100\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" frameborder=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982917&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\\\"></iframe>\\n\\nI think it's all about recognizing that you're operating on very little information. Do things that keep as many options open to you as possible, and don't fall into the trap of rationalizing what just feels comfortable or what you've already had positive feedback on. \\n\\n> <div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">It never shocks me how many people think about their relationships the way they should think about work, and they think about work the way they should think about their relationships. </div>\\n\\nFor some people I know, when you ask them why they’re dating someone, they’re like, “Well, they’re a nice person.” Do you think going to marry them? “No, not really.” The more you date them the more likely you are to end up marrying them just out of momentum! And your dream person might be down the hall but is not even approaching you because you're dating that other person. So you're closing your doors just out of comfort, just for having a warm body around. \\n\\nAnd then when it comes to a job they’re like, “No, I'm not going to take that job because it's not _perfect_.” They'll go into this paralysis around work, and it should be the exact opposite. If you think that there's a job that seems decent and it's not hell on earth but you’re going to learn something—and you learn something at every job—do that. But while you're doing that, keep a lookout for other opportunities and swing from that vine to the next. \\n\\nMeanwhile with your relationships — go have coffee with a lot of people, but only when you see somebody that makes you think, \\\"Hey, I could marry that person\\\" or \\\"I can spend my life with that person,\\\" then commit! It's amazing how people tend to get the two most important things completely confused. \\n\\n---\\n*Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

I thought I wanted to be a theoretical physicist or mathematician and try to solve the great mysteries of the universe. Once I got to college I kept that interest, but computer science was already a field and it was getting hotter in the mid-1990s. And then I realized that more than just understanding reality, you can start creating realities here. On the pragmatic side, you started to see stories of people founding these great companies and doing well.</p>\n<p>That was my first career out of college — I worked at Oracle and then I worked at a finance-related startup called <a href=\"http://https://www.forbes.com/2000/07/08/feat2.html\">meVC</a>. It was going to democratize venture capital and I was the CTO at the ripe age of 22 years old. It grew to 40 people and I was the first employee there — the founders were two bankers who hired me. And then the NASDAQ popped, and it became survival mode. That day, I thought maybe I should apply to business school.</p>\n<p>At the time, my thinking about business school was that clearly something is happening to the world and the economy, and I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life. I had this tech thing, but I found it somewhat emotionally traumatic because everyday is like a roller coaster. One day you're daydreaming about your future stock wealth, another day you're wondering if you’ll ever be able to buy a house.</p>\n<p>So I thought business school would allow me to think more about what I want to do. I always had an interest being a broader generalist, but my resume definitely was pigeonholing me into CTO-type positions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ac0Kq3jSsp4/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Khan Commencement Address\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Sal Khan delivering the Class Day address at Harvard Business School in 2014.</p></em></p>\n<p>I'd be lying if I didn't tell you part of my motivation was that I was very lonely and wanted a wife. I thought, school is a good place to meet people and figure out life. So I went to business school and I was exploring my options. I actually found the finance classes quite intriguing: it was this neat combination of math, economics, and human psychology. I got more and more interested in markets.</p>\n<p>The second year, I took a capital markets class and my professor and I had a rapport. I asked him, “I really love this class, what can I do that is like this?” And he said, “You should go work at a hedge fund.” And I said, “That sounds great... what's a hedge fund?” If you ask someone what's a hedge fund, you will get many not-so-clear answers.</p>\n<p>I started asking around and I obviously had a lot of debt at that point so it looked like a really intriguing thing.</p>\n<div id=\"1\"></div> \n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">I applied and probably got turned down from 40 different places. It was a horrible job market.</div>\n<p>For most of the people who want to go into hedge funds or private equity or these more selective financial careers, they have been building their resumes from the get go: they work at Goldman Sachs, and they get an internship at this private equity firm or this hedge fund. Mine looked nothing like that. I was getting a lot of inquiries from tech companies and even tech VC firms, but no one in the hedge fund world. But eventually there was this guy who was operating out of his house; his nascent hedge fund was starting to do well and he wanted to hire his first analyst. This was April of my second year when most of my peers had jobs already. I thought it'll at least get my foot in the door.</p>\n<p>I was lucky. Dan Wohl, my boss at Wohl Capital, was an incredible investor so I was able to learn a ton from him, not just on the financial or industry side, but also on how one should live their life. I was really enjoying that job, and I didn't view it as a temporary thing. When I was a year or two into it I was very happy and satisfied with where I was going, and based on Dan's investment acumen, we were doing well. But I had visions of one day starting a school.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">In college, I got rejected for the Rhodes Scholarship twice.

It's actually interesting that most people — based on my background and even stereotypes about Khan Academy — assume the analyst role must have been at a quantitative hedge fund, doing algorithmic trading. But it was actually the opposite: we were a qualitative hedge fund. I wanted to do that because while there was definitely a quantitative aspect to it in modeling an organization’s financials and making predictions, there was also a more human picture to it.</p>\n<p>Most of my day involved doing research on these companies, modeling and talking to their management teams to make sure I understood their business. Dan taught me to really listen closely and think about what is being said without it being said. Seeing when people are hesitant and what they choose to highlight, you can actually learn a lot about human psychology.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://bestreviewof.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Khan.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Videos\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Sal making videos in the earlier days of the Academy.</p></em></p>\n<p>In the Khan Academy world, in the early days I was making videos on math and science, so that's where my background helped a lot. I had an interest in those subjects and already had a strong view that most people weren't learning them in an intuitive way. Once Khan Academy started to get off the ground, I think the technical part was definitely important because for the early prototypes of the software on Khan Academy, I was coding stuff myself.</p>\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\nBut I also think the hedge fund background was important when it was time to decide what the structure of this organization should be. There were already VCs who were walking up and saying I'll write a check for this much right now, we could do a double bottom line organization and one day we can have some premium services, and this and that. But through my work in the hedge fund world I had become a student of capital structure. \n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"font-size:21.6px\"> I've seen that no matter what the founder thinks he or she wants, at the end of the day, it is the owners or the stakeholders in the economic future of the entity that are, in the long term, going to decide what the entity becomes. </div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn't want to undermine that trust that people had in Khan Academy, and I didn't want it to change even after I was dead. I still dream that it's going to be around 500 years from now.</p>\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\n**How did you go about deciding to leave your job and pursue Khan Academy full-time?**\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982801&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n<p>It's funny because I would always tell myself that I was relatively risk averse, but if you look at the arc of my career, even a two person hedge fund isn't most people's notions of stability. Compared to quitting my job, it was.</p>\n<p>I’ve thought a lot about this question when I was coming out of college and when I was thinking about doing Khan Academy full time. The more you put something out there and get evidence of strong product market fit and traction, and the more you can get that evidence while keeping your options open, the better. So if you are a Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates and you're in your dorm room in Harvard during sophomore year, you need a lot of evidence to convince yourself not just to leave a stable job, but to drop out of college. You shouldn't do that just from being inspired by some idea. Bill Gates had a contract with IBM, which was the tech company of the time, and Mark Zuckerberg clearly had this thing that was growing 10,000% a year with a lot of traction and no sign of stopping. So, if you hit on something like that, quit your job — you'd be nuts not to do it or at least to take some time off.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.glassdoor.com/l/452278/khan-academy-office.jpg\" alt=\"Khan Academy office\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Khan Academy now has over a hundred employees at its Mountain View office.</p></em></p>\n<p>But that's not going to be the norm. I would tell most people, including a younger version of myself, that it is good to go to a more established place right out of college. It insulates your resume just as going to a good college is something people will never take away from you. If early on in your career, you have a Google, a Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, or a Khan Academy on your resume, people will know it. They'll have heard of it and they’ll know those companies only hire certain people. They'll also think you probably learned something interesting at those firms that you can bring it to their firm.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">The key is that if you do have an entrepreneurial desire long-term, don't let that atrophy.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once you're at five to six years in the industry, that's your first wave where you've learned a lot and it's not unreasonable to start thinking entrepreneurially. You're in your late 20s, you still don't have many mouths to feed and you kind of have a sense of how the world works. But even then, don't just do it on a whim.  Put something out there and prototype it. See if you can get some fit.</p>\n<p>I started tutoring my cousins in 2004, made videos in 2006, and I didn't quit my job until 2009 when there were already about 50,000 people who were using it. So it took me a while to make the plunge and even then it was super scary. There is a fun element to it: adventures are fun, but mostly in hindsight. When you don't know how it's going to end, it's incredibly stressful and scary. But one thing I did tell myself is that even if I have to go back to work in a traditional sense, I wasn't going to give up on this Khan Academy thing. So try to structure your endeavour in a way that it's kind of unkillable.</p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned that Dan Wohl was an important mentor for you. What are some of the key lessons that you learned from him in terms of your life principles and also from other important mentors that you had in your life?</strong></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982982&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n<p>I’ve had a lot of great mentors. My first boss at Oracle was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kurian\">Thomas Kurian</a>. He was a fairly young guy at the time; now he's the President of Product Development at Oracle. He was very clear in telling me not to get cynical.  It's very easy to get cynical, especially early in your life, and even more so coming out of college. You leave college very idealistic, you go to a big company and you start to wonder whether you matter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">Avoid becoming cynical yourself, and definitely avoid the cynical people. Because then it just turns into a death spiral of cynicism, and that's not going to help anybody.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No matter what it seems like, wake up every morning and show up asking: what can I do today to make the most of this experience and to make it matter that I was there? Even when I was miserable in different kinds of jobs, when you take that attitude it becomes a challenge and it's more fun.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blogs-images.forbes.com/oracle/files/2015/06/06_22_cloudlaunch_Kurian-.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Kurian\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Sal was one of Thomas Kurian's first direct reports when he started at Oracle.</p></em></p>\n<div id=\"4\"></div>\nThere's a bunch of stuff that I learned from Dan. I was ready to work 80 hours a week for him and he told me to go home. He said our job as investors is not to just work ourselves silly. That's just going impair our judgment. If you work too much on something you get so married to that idea that you're not going to know when to pull out of it.\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">Overprecision creates the illusion of artificial accuracy.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I even try to stress this in our own team when we're overanalyzing things. With overanalysis, you think you're mitigating risk, but you're actually increasing your risk by psychologically marrying yourself because you did so much analysis. Dan said our job is to make only a few really good decisions a year and to avoid making really bad decisions. And the best way you can do that is to have perspective, to be recharged. You can't define yourself by your job.</p>\n<p>I was working a solid 40 hours a week but those 40 hours were intense. If I didn't have that life outside of Wohl Capital, I wouldn't have been able to offer Nadia help. I wouldn't have had time to prototype software. So what I tell people is go learn your skills early in your career, find great mentors, work hard, learn a ton, and push yourself. Always ask questions. Ask for critical feedback and show that you can take it. But you should also leave some space for your passions and your interests, and that might blossom into something interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources like Khan Academy provide individuals with more agency over their education than ever before. At the same time, people are getting more distracted by social media and push notifications. Where do you see Khan Academy’s role in keeping people engaged, and what advice do you have for dealing with today's distractions?</strong></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982943&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n<div id=\"5\"></div>\nI'll start with the latter. I think it's super important to be unplugged. For someone who works in technology, many people, including my wife, are often annoyed by how inaccessible I am via technology. \n><div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">I don't touch my phone over the weekend. I don't touch it after six o'clock. I actually barely look at it during the day.</div>\n<p>And I think that's really important. It's not just becoming scatterbrained. You'll become unhappy if you are constantly rechecking your phone for the next dopamine rush, which is what most people are doing. And it is correlated with depression rates and anxiety.</p>\n<p>In terms of Khan Academy's role, we want to make sure what we create is compelling and interesting, to create game mechanics and use the latest science out there to make it more engaging so that we can compete with all the distractions. But at the end of day, it's on the individual. It's an interesting dynamic because as you mentioned now with massive open online courses and Khan Academy, the knowledge is way more accessible. When I was 20 years old, if I really wanted to learn something on my own, I'd go to a library and get a pretty dense textbook and try to power through it. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. Now if you have that motivation, the tools make it way easier for you to do it. But then you have these competing sources of information.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/y39Hhy7.png\" alt=\"Khan Academy homepage\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Khan Academy uses design principles and interactivity to make its product more engaging for users.</p></em></p>\n<p>The world is going to stay competitive, and I think the people who are able to have the discipline to quarantine or to compartmentalize around the distractions, to realize when they're okay and when they're unhealthy, and to dedicate efforts to bettering themselves with the many tools that exist — those are the people that are going to do better.</p>\n<p>You're in a big game, and to win the game is to be a happy productive person — it isn’t to become rich or famous. And to become a happy productive person, you want to feel like you have a job that's creative or you have enough economic freedom that you can do the things you want in life without comparing yourself to others and constantly looking for that dopamine rush from your phone.</p>\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for people who are deciding between different career paths?</strong></p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/333982917&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe>\n<p>I think it's all about recognizing that you're operating on very little information. Do things that keep as many options open to you as possible, and don't fall into the trap of rationalizing what just feels comfortable or what you've already had positive feedback on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"font-size:21.6px\">It never shocks me how many people think about their relationships the way they should think about work, and they think about work the way they should think about their relationships. </div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For some people I know, when you ask them why they’re dating someone, they’re like, “Well, they’re a nice person.” Do you think going to marry them? “No, not really.” The more you date them the more likely you are to end up marrying them just out of momentum! And your dream person might be down the hall but is not even approaching you because you're dating that other person. So you're closing your doors just out of comfort, just for having a warm body around.</p>\n<p>And then when it comes to a job they’re like, “No, I'm not going to take that job because it's not <em>perfect</em>.” They'll go into this paralysis around work, and it should be the exact opposite. If you think that there's a job that seems decent and it's not hell on earth but you’re going to learn something—and you learn something at every job—do that. But while you're doing that, keep a lookout for other opportunities and swing from that vine to the next.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile with your relationships — go have coffee with a lot of people, but only when you see somebody that makes you think, &quot;Hey, I could marry that person&quot; or &quot;I can spend my life with that person,&quot; then commit! It's amazing how people tend to get the two most important things completely confused.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

But through my work in the hedge fund world I had\nbecome a student of capital structure.  I've seen that no matter what the\nfounder thinks he or she wants, at the end of the day, it is the owners or the\nstakeholders in the economic future of the entity that are, in the long term,\ngoing to decide what the entity becomes. I didn't want to undermine that trust\nthat people had in Khan Academy, and I didn't want it to change even after I was\ndead. I still dream that it's going to be around 500 years from now.\n\n**How did you go about deciding to leave your job and pursue Khan Academy\nfull-time?**It's funny because I would always tell myself that I was relatively\nrisk averse, but if you look at the arc of my career, even a two person hedge\nfund isn't most people's notions of stability. Compared to quitting my job, it\nwas.\n\nI’ve thought a lot about this question when I was coming out of college and when\nI was thinking about doing Khan Academy full time. The more you put something\nout there and get evidence of strong product market fit and traction, and the\nmore you can get that evidence while keeping your options open, the better. So\nif you are a Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates and you're in your dorm room in\nHarvard during sophomore year, you need a lot of evidence to convince yourself\nnot just to leave a stable job, but to drop out of college. You shouldn't do\nthat just from being inspired by some idea. Bill Gates had a contract with IBM,\nwhich was the tech company of the time, and Mark Zuckerberg clearly had this\nthing that was growing 10,000% a year with a lot of traction and no sign of\nstopping. So, if you hit on something like that, quit your job — you'd be nuts\nnot to do it or at least to take some time off.\n\nKhan Academy now has over a hundred employees at its Mountain View office.\n\n\n\nBut that's not going to be the norm. I would tell most people, including a\nyounger version of myself, that it is good to go to a more established place\nright out of college. It insulates your resume just as going to a good college\nis something people will never take away from you. If early on in your career,\nyou have a Google, a Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, or a Khan Academy on your resume,\npeople will know it. They'll have heard of it and they’ll know those companies\nonly hire certain people. They'll also think you probably learned something\ninteresting at those firms that you can bring it to their firm.\n\nThe key is that if you do have an entrepreneurial desire long-term, don't let\nthat atrophy.Once you're at five to six years in the industry, that's your first\nwave where you've learned a lot and it's not unreasonable to start thinking\nentrepreneurially. You're in your late 20s, you still don't have many mouths to\nfeed and you kind of have a sense of how the world works. But even then, don't\njust do it on a whim. Put something out there and prototype it. See if you can\nget some fit.\n\nI started tutoring my cousins in 2004, made videos in 2006, and I didn't quit my\njob until 2009 when there were already about 50,000 people who were using it. So\nit took me a while to make the plunge and even then it was super scary. There is\na fun element to it: adventures are fun, but mostly in hindsight. When you don't\nknow how it's going to end, it's incredibly stressful and scary. But one thing I\ndid tell myself is that even if I have to go back to work in a traditional\nsense, I wasn't going to give up on this Khan Academy thing. So try to structure\nyour endeavour in a way that it's kind of unkillable.\n\nYou mentioned that Dan Wohl was an important mentor for you. What are some of\nthe key lessons that you learned from him in terms of your life principles and\nalso from other important mentors that you had in your life?\n\nI’ve had a lot of great mentors. My first boss at Oracle was Thomas Kurian\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kurian]. He was a fairly young guy at the\ntime; now he's the President of Product Development at Oracle. He was very clear\nin telling me not to get cynical. It's very easy to get cynical, especially\nearly in your life, and even more so coming out of college. You leave college\nvery idealistic, you go to a big company and you start to wonder whether you\nmatter.\n\nAvoid becoming cynical yourself, and definitely avoid the cynical people.\nBecause then it just turns into a death spiral of cynicism, and that's not going\nto help anybody.No matter what it seems like, wake up every morning and show up\nasking: what can I do today to make the most of this experience and to make it\nmatter that I was there? Even when I was miserable in different kinds of jobs,\nwhen you take that attitude it becomes a challenge and it's more fun.\n\nSal was one of Thomas Kurian's first direct reports when he started at Oracle.\n\n\n\nThere's a bunch of stuff that I learned from Dan. I was ready to work 80 hours a\nweek for him and he told me to go home. He said our job as investors is not to\njust work ourselves silly. That's just going impair our judgment. If you work\ntoo much on something you get so married to that idea that you're not going to\nknow when to pull out of it.Overprecision creates the illusion of artificial\naccuracy.I even try to stress this in our own team when we're overanalyzing\nthings. With overanalysis, you think you're mitigating risk, but you're actually\nincreasing your risk by psychologically marrying yourself because you did so\nmuch analysis. Dan said our job is to make only a few really good decisions a\nyear and to avoid making really bad decisions. And the best way you can do that\nis to have perspective, to be recharged. You can't define yourself by your job.\n\nI was working a solid 40 hours a week but those 40 hours were intense. If I\ndidn't have that life outside of Wohl Capital, I wouldn't have been able to\noffer Nadia help. I wouldn't have had time to prototype software. So what I tell\npeople is go learn your skills early in your career, find great mentors, work\nhard, learn a ton, and push yourself. Always ask questions. Ask for critical\nfeedback and show that you can take it. But you should also leave some space for\nyour passions and your interests, and that might blossom into something\ninteresting.\n\nResources like Khan Academy provide individuals with more agency over their\neducation than ever before. At the same time, people are getting more distracted\nby social media and push notifications. Where do you see Khan Academy’s role in\nkeeping people engaged, and what advice do you have for dealing with today's\ndistractions?\n\nI'll start with the latter. I think it's super important to be unplugged. For\nsomeone who works in technology, many people, including my wife, are often\nannoyed by how inaccessible I am via technology. \n>I don't touch my phone over the weekend. I don't touch it after six o'clock. I\nactually barely look at it during the day.And I think that's really important.\nIt's not just becoming scatterbrained. You'll become unhappy if you are\nconstantly rechecking your phone for the next dopamine rush, which is what most\npeople are doing. And it is correlated with depression rates and anxiety.\n\nIn terms of Khan Academy's role, we want to make sure what we create is\ncompelling and interesting, to create game mechanics and use the latest science\nout there to make it more engaging so that we can compete with all the\ndistractions. But at the end of day, it's on the individual. It's an interesting\ndynamic because as you mentioned now with massive open online courses and Khan\nAcademy, the knowledge is way more accessible. When I was 20 years old, if I\nreally wanted to learn something on my own, I'd go to a library and get a pretty\ndense textbook and try to power through it. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it\ndidn't. Now if you have that motivation, the tools make it way easier for you to\ndo it. But then you have these competing sources of information.\n\nKhan Academy uses design principles and interactivity to make its product more\nengaging for users.\n\n\n\nThe world is going to stay competitive, and I think the people who are able to\nhave the discipline to quarantine or to compartmentalize around the\ndistractions, to realize when they're okay and when they're unhealthy, and to\ndedicate efforts to bettering themselves with the many tools that exist — those\nare the people that are going to do better.\n\nYou're in a big game, and to win the game is to be a happy productive person —\nit isn’t to become rich or famous. And to become a happy productive person, you\nwant to feel like you have a job that's creative or you have enough economic\nfreedom that you can do the things you want in life without comparing yourself\nto others and constantly looking for that dopamine rush from your phone.\n\nWhat advice do you have for people who are deciding between different career\npaths?\n\nI think it's all about recognizing that you're operating on very little\ninformation. Do things that keep as many options open to you as possible, and\ndon't fall into the trap of rationalizing what just feels comfortable or what\nyou've already had positive feedback on.\n\nIt never shocks me how many people think about their relationships the way they\nshould think about work, and they think about work the way they should think\nabout their relationships. For some people I know, when you ask them why they’re\ndating someone, they’re like, “Well, they’re a nice person.” Do you think going\nto marry them? “No, not really.” The more you date them the more likely you are\nto end up marrying them just out of momentum! And your dream person might be\ndown the hall but is not even approaching you because you're dating that other\nperson. So you're closing your doors just out of comfort, just for having a warm\nbody around.\n\nAnd then when it comes to a job they’re like, “No, I'm not going to take that\njob because it's not perfect.” They'll go into this paralysis around work, and\nit should be the exact opposite. If you think that there's a job that seems\ndecent and it's not hell on earth but you’re going to learn something—and you\nlearn something at every job—do that. But while you're doing that, keep a\nlookout for other opportunities and swing from that vine to the next.\n\nMeanwhile with your relationships — go have coffee with a lot of people, but\nonly when you see somebody that makes you think, \"Hey, I could marry that\nperson\" or \"I can spend my life with that person,\" then commit! It's amazing how\npeople tend to get the two most important things completely confused.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

My family wasn’t rich but we were well off. However, I was a very unhappy kid who couldn’t find any success in school, had a very small group of friends, and couldn’t figure out why I should make an effort at anything. I faced immense pressure from my dad, who expected me to be a kicker in the NFL and a Nobel Prize winner at the same time. \\n\\n<img src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1376143/thumbs/a-VIVIENNE-MING-640x468.jpg?6\\\" alt=\\\"Sal Khan Commencement Address\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Vivienne, pre-transition, as Evan Smith graduating college in May 2000.</p>*\\n\\nAfter high school, I effectively flunked out of college, became homeless, and lived out of my car. All of the wonderful things I started off with, I squandered by the time I was 20. And with most stories like this, it involved intimate moments with suicide. There was a point in time in which I sat in my car in the middle of the night with a loaded gun shoved into my mouth and my finger on the trigger. I mention it not because it’s what I want to highlight, but rather because such moments incite real change in your life. \\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">It’s not the beautiful moments that matter, but the moments in which you need a reason to be alive.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n**What reason did you find that night?**\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWell, nothing came to me so I had to make one for myself. If I would never be truly happy, my purpose was to make everyone else’s life better. Maybe this comes off as a la-di-da perspective, but slowly, I got myself back into life from one small job to another. None of them made me happy, but that’s not the point. The point is that with small steps, I proved that I could actually take care of myself. I saved enough money to go back to school and finish the last half of my degree in under a year. What changed was that I went back to school for a specific purpose — to make other people better.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n**It seems like many college students today struggle to find that purpose. It just seems like such an intangible concept.**\\n\\nWhatever you are doing right now, whether you like it or not, go all in. Your parents are forcing you to be an engineer even though you want to be something else? Go all in and be the best engineer you can be.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nFor example, years ago I made a new glucose monitor for my son, who has Type 2 Diabetes, and it worked better than anything readily available at the time. The doctors fitted him with a monitor that could notify you of an imminent low blood sugar episode twenty minutes *after* the first drop was detected. Twenty minutes! That’s a lifetime for a worried-to-death mother! \\n\\n<img src=\\\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1376209/thumbs/a-NORMA-AND-VIVIENNE-MING-640x468.jpg?6\\\" alt=\\\"Sal Khan Commencement Address\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Vivienne with her wife, Norma, and their two children.</p>*\\n\\nI probably broke a few laws, but — for lack of a better word — I \\\"hacked” into his monitor to see how it obtained data, and decided I could do much better. I had my son wear a Fitbit and countless other tracking devices for months. After downloading all of the data and running tests, I finally settled on a model that could actually predict his first blood sugar drop twenty minutes in advance! I could have just stayed content with the current data and technology. Instead, I decided to create something that makes people better off.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n**So is this the key to finding purpose and happiness? Be insanely good at something? What if your first guess isn’t the right one?**\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nBe ready to move on and find the next thing. You need to be ready to die and start over again.\\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">So you just became the best engineer — now die and reincarnate as a journalist. Then an entrepreneur. A writer. A politician.\\n\\nAll my richest moments in life have been these moments of transition. You combine everything you learned from the last life with the problems and tools of the new life, and make things nobody has ever thought of before.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nSome of those moments have come out of the blue. I began working in a theoretical neuroscience lab because a professor recommended me. I had no background in machine learning at that point. We were researching the use of artificial intelligence to analyze real-time lie detection in videos for the CIA. Later, I used that same tech to help autistic kids read facial expressions and to help refugees find lost family members from facial recognition in grainy pictures. Being able to have such an impact was huge for me.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n**Have you walked away from anything huge because it didn’t align with your purpose?**\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nYeah — I declined Uber’s offer to be their Chief Scientist. Taking this position meant becoming ridiculously wealthy and powerful, but my purpose isn’t self-driving cars or making Travis Kalanick ridiculously rich. I walked away because my purpose is just to help people.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nAmazon had a better pitch. At the time, they were about to reach 100,000 employees and wanted me to figure out how to motivate such a large workforce. It was quite the opportunity — helping 100,000 people at once! I live for this so I offered to do it for free, but they never got back to me.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"4\\\"></div>\\t\\n**Given LGBT Pride Month happened recently, and the political news around transgender discrimination, we wanted to hear the story of your transition.**\\n\\nI worried about transitioning for a very long time, especially since I was working at my first job at a small company in Texas. In any other life, it could’ve gone horribly. Surprisingly, my boss and coworkers were so accepting. They didn’t treat me any differently afterwards. Sure, they tripped up here and there with the name and pronouns, and some asked odd questions that were only out of genuine curiosity. But overall, their support made the process that much easier. That was a key step to becoming happy.\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nWhat I said earlier about dying and being reborn again? This was one of those moments. It was complete chance that I came out on my birthday. It’s a literal birthday with double meaning.\\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">Gender transition isn’t just about gender. It’s about making yourself a better person.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"5\\\"></div>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n**Gender has been a big part of not just your identity, but also of your work on diversity in the workplace. Your article, [The Tax on Being Different](http://moment.vivienneming.com/2015/05/the-tax-on-being-different/), is a groundbreaking, data-focused look into discrimination in hiring practices.**\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nI’ve always been interested in this. It was something I wanted to solve as Chief Scientist at Gild, a startup that was trying to change the hiring and promotion process through software that ranks candidates by measurable skills and hides any information that may bias the recruiter. For most employment decisions, everything amounts to an “annual 360” in which the manager is the only one in charge of making recommendations for promotion or hire. All of this is terrible. Women and people of color are being systematically undervalued.\\n><div style=\\\"font-size:21.6px\\\">My research shows that women tend to do more untracked and uncompensated work than men, but only get recognition for 50 percent of what men get recognition for. \\n\\nWhy would women ever want to enter the workforce then? If I’m building a human resources system, I’m building one in which I’m tracking all of your emails, Slack conversations, and movements in the building. If she meets with someone outside of her team and I see that this other team is more productive, she’s having twice the impact on this company than what her direct manager might see from just formal data, like a survey.\\n\\n*(Editor's note: For more information, see Vivienne's video on [The Anatomy of a Hire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZD2XoLnEuY).)*\\n\\n**Data analytics is in everything now. What’s the best way to get students interested?**\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nStart off by looking at data that’s already there. So many people are trying to predict data now but we can learn so much by observing natural things around us. Humans behave naturally, but tests, models, and surveys are in no way natural.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nWhen people think of data, they think you just need people to fill out survey forms. In truth, simple things like tracking the trajectory of your cursor across the survey form on a computer screen and seeing how it shifts towards alternate boxes is informative. By tracking the cursor, you are measuring the person’s behavior and personality — latent things that otherwise can be inaccessible.\\n\\n*(Editor’s note: At Penn, MKTG351, taught by Michael Platt, teaches neuroscience marketing.

In 2013, she was named one of \"10 Women to Watch in Tech\" by\nInc. Magazine for her work developing a new model for predicting glucose levels\nin diabetics and manic episodes in people with bipolar disorder. In addition,\nshe is an outspoken advocate for diversity in tech. Dr. Ming — who is a\ntransgender woman — has had a unique comeback story: she dropped out of college\nand became homeless, before eventually returning and finishing a Ph.D. at\nCarnegie Mellon University in Psychology and Theoretical Neuroscience. Inspired\nby her personal struggles, Dr. Ming decided to devote her life's research to\nanalyzing purpose.\n\nThis feature is an aggregate of multiple informal conversations we had with Dr.\nMing. Transcript edited for clarity.\n\nStories worth noting:\n<tr>\n    <td>1)</td>      \n    <td>From dropping out of college to graduating at the top of her class</td>\n\n\nRead\n\n 2)  \n Hacking into her son's glucose monitor and making it ten times betterRead\n 3)  \n How to \"die and reincarnate\" into different dream careersRead</tr>\n\n\n4)  \n Vivienne's transitionRead\n 5)  \n Using data to track inequality in the workplaceRead</tr>\n\n\nCould you tell us a bit about your lowest point and eventual comeback?\n\nActually, in the very beginning, when I was still a straight white male, life\nwas pretty good. My family wasn’t rich but we were well off. However, I was a\nvery unhappy kid who couldn’t find any success in school, had a very small group\nof friends, and couldn’t figure out why I should make an effort at anything. I\nfaced immense pressure from my dad, who expected me to be a kicker in the NFL\nand a Nobel Prize winner at the same time.\n\nVivienne, pre-transition, as Evan Smith graduating college in May 2000.\n\n\n\nAfter high school, I effectively flunked out of college, became homeless, and\nlived out of my car. All of the wonderful things I started off with, I\nsquandered by the time I was 20. And with most stories like this, it involved\nintimate moments with suicide. There was a point in time in which I sat in my\ncar in the middle of the night with a loaded gun shoved into my mouth and my\nfinger on the trigger. I mention it not because it’s what I want to highlight,\nbut rather because such moments incite real change in your life.\n\nIt’s not the beautiful moments that matter, but the moments in which you need a\nreason to be alive.What reason did you find that night?\n\nWell, nothing came to me so I had to make one for myself. If I would never be\ntruly happy, my purpose was to make everyone else’s life better. Maybe this\ncomes off as a la-di-da perspective, but slowly, I got myself back into life\nfrom one small job to another. None of them made me happy, but that’s not the\npoint. The point is that with small steps, I proved that I could actually take\ncare of myself. I saved enough money to go back to school and finish the last\nhalf of my degree in under a year. What changed was that I went back to school\nfor a specific purpose — to make other people better.\n\n**It seems like many college students today struggle to find that purpose. It\njust seems like such an intangible concept.**Whatever you are doing right now,\nwhether you like it or not, go all in. Your parents are forcing you to be an\nengineer even though you want to be something else? Go all in and be the best\nengineer you can be.\n\nFor example, years ago I made a new glucose monitor for my son, who has Type 2\nDiabetes, and it worked better than anything readily available at the time. The\ndoctors fitted him with a monitor that could notify you of an imminent low blood\nsugar episode twenty minutes after  the first drop was detected. Twenty minutes!\nThat’s a lifetime for a worried-to-death mother!\n\nVivienne with her wife, Norma, and their two children.\n\n\n\nI probably broke a few laws, but — for lack of a better word — I \"hacked” into\nhis monitor to see how it obtained data, and decided I could do much better. I\nhad my son wear a Fitbit and countless other tracking devices for months. After\ndownloading all of the data and running tests, I finally settled on a model that\ncould actually predict his first blood sugar drop twenty minutes in advance! I\ncould have just stayed content with the current data and technology. Instead, I\ndecided to create something that makes people better off.\n\n**So is this the key to finding purpose and happiness? Be insanely good at\nsomething? What if your first guess isn’t the right one?**Be ready to move on\nand find the next thing.

It's never too late to switch into a career that aligns well with your\n    passions.\n 2. Some of the best skills and lessons are learned through your\n    extracurriculars rather than your classes.\n 3. Start small and work your way up. Every firm or role can be a stepping stone\n    towards that dream career.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNicole graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences\nin 1983 with a BA in Comparative Literature and from Stanford University with a\nmaster's degree in Documentary Production. Since then, she has built up an\nimpressive movie track record, including Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Bug's Life, \nRatatouille, The Incredibles, Toy Story 3, and the short story, Sanjay's Super\nTeam [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4661600/], for which she was directly\nnominated for an Academy Award.\n\nEditor: I first spoke with Nicole in the summer of 2016. Though at the time I\nwas a trading intern, I grew up around the arts and could not shake off the\nfeeling that it was my calling. During our conversation, I mentioned my fears of\nswitching my plans so late in the game, especially into a field I barely studied\nin college. She told me of her decision to switch from bioengineering to\ncomparative literature when she was in my exact shoes. Though it was such a\nrisky decision, her later success came from her persistence in studying what she\nknew she loved.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTell me about your background leading up to this job. How did you recruit for\nit?\nAfter graduating from Penn, where I had produced a few short training videos for\nthe school, I went on to get a Masters in Documentary Film at Stanford. When I\nfinished there, I wasn’t quite ready to start making a documentary film of my\nown and really needed to pay the rent, so I got a job at Industrial Light Magic\nas a production assistant on Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Turns out I really enjoyed\nthat work, and soon heard about another opportunity at a small company that\ncreated animated commercials and MTV station ID’s.\n\nAfter seven years of learning about animation and producing, I came to Pixar. At\nthe time, they had only produced some short films and commercials. I arrived\njust as production was ending on the first Toy Story. Initially, I joined only\nto produce an interactive CD-ROM game but ended up staying after it was finished\nto work on feature films. I had never worked in computer animation until then,\nso I had a lot to learn. You have to remember that it was an incredibly new\nmedium at that time, so nobody knew much about it then.\n\nWhat is the typical path to become a producer?\nThere really is no typical path to becoming a producer. Some folks move through\nthe ranks, while others come in with outside experience and move directly into\nthat role.\n\nThe producer is ultimately the primary advocate for getting the film done and\nmaking sure it’s great while working within the necessary schedule and budget\nconstraints. The production management structure works to support that effort\nunder the producer’s leadership.\n\nAt Pixar, the production management structure is:\n\nInternship —> Production Assistant —> Coordinator —> Department Manager —>\nProduction Manager —> Associate Producer —> Producer\n\nThe associate producer focuses on specific, day to day management of the Pixar\nteam, budget and schedule. This role can benefit from a business background, but\nit is not necessary. It is important to be a filmmaker first and foremost.\n\nI like Disney-Pixar's emphasis on social issues and breaking barriers in recent\nyears, especially in Brave  and Sanjay's Super Team. How did Pixar carry out\nthis change and what do you see Pixar exploring in the near future?\nIt wasn't a specific executive decision to make more “diverse” films, but there\nhas been recognition that we need a more diverse group of storytellers. I’m\ncurrently involved in mentoring a group of young women artists and hoping that\nout of this group a director eventually arises.\n\nIt’s exciting to see that the whole film industry is recognizing we need to\ninclude more women as writers and directors, as well as people from all kinds of\ndifferent cultural backgrounds.\n\nWhat can current students look forward to in terms of changes and developments\nin the animation and media industry in the next five years?\nOpportunities in media in general and the animation industry in particular will\ncontinue to grow as more and more content is available on TV and over the\ninternet from a bunch of different networks — much like the recent emergence of\nNetflix and Amazon. Additionally, the next big frontier is virtual reality.\nEverybody is trying to figure out how to create and distribute entertainment\ncontent with a non-linear narrative.\n\nWhat soft and technical skills are most useful to succeed as a producer?\nSoft skills are often under-rated when you’re in school, and are the most\ncritical to being an effective producer. You need to be able to have a vision,\nthink critically, rise above the fray to move an effort forward, and work with\nall kinds of different people to bring the best work out of them in the service\nof your project or to persuade them to support what you’re doing. Technical\nskills are often a lot more straight-forward to acquire and use when needed.\n\nAre there roles in animation firms for non-artsy or non-technical people?\nThere are some MBAs here with a finance background that manage financials and\nanalyze our process. Animation is a rather labor-intensive undertaking and we\ntypically have over 300 people work on a film over the course of production and\ndistribution. Our finance people provide us a detailed analysis of what part of\nour pipeline is working efficiently and what isn’t.\n\nIf you could go back to Penn, what would you definitely take advantage of?\nI would definitely take a computer animation course.\n\nWhat advice would you give to young Penn students who are considering a career\nlike this?\nA strong liberal arts education will serve you well if you want to be a\nvisionary and creative leader.\n\nI started out in bioengineering and ended up in comparative literature while\nparticipating in every incarnation of theater available at Penn at the time. In\nmy senior year, I was the director and chair of Bloomers where I found myself\nultimately responsible for pulling together a spring show. It was incredibly\nchallenging and ultimately enormously rewarding, and taught me a whole lot about\nworking with a team of talented people to create something out of nothing. \nEditor's note: Bloomers is Penn's all-female comedy troupe.\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

How did you balance that with your studies at Wharton?** \\n\\nBeing an entrepreneur requires a certain set of skills, including persistence, determination, and resilience. It’s something that is tied to your identity and it is certainly not a 9-to-5 job. It’s a 24/7 mentality for me. College is the best time to be an entrepreneur because there is an abundance of resources available for students. There are business plan competitions, grants, research stipends, and fellowships. There are many people who want to help student entrepreneurs succeed and student founders are tasked with finding the best way to navigate the entrepreneurial ecosystem. \\n\\n**One issue I see is a lot of people have ideas but it’s hard to decide whether it’s worth taking on full-time or to keep it as just a side project. What convinced you to pursue GenHERation full-time?**\\n\\nAt the end of my junior summer, before the President’s Engagement Prize was announced, I knew I was going to be an entrepreneur full-time after graduation. I received the Wharton Venture Award, which provides $10,000 to rising seniors or second year MBAs to pursue their own venture the summer before their last year of school. At the end of that summer, we had hosted a five-city Summer Leadership Series and grew from 200 to 5,000 users. I thought if we could achieve these milestones during a three-month period, imagine what we could do when we’re working on the startup full time! \\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDWqpWHq4yw?rel=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n**Let’s shift to the Millennial Trains Project you were in while still in school. The premise is so unique — tell us about it.**\\n\\nThe Millennial Trains Project (MTP) was a transformational experience. MTP is a cross-country train trip for millennial leaders working to advance social impact projects around the world. My cohort traveled from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. over the course of ten days while visiting historical landmarks along the way. The participants on the train were some of the most inspiring people I have ever met and continue to be an active group of change-makers. The Millennial Trains Project helped me recognize the power of travel and its ability to create new communities.\\n\\n \\n**How did you first hear about the Millennial Trains Project?**\\n\\nI was at a demo day for Wharton Entrepreneurship in the spring of 2015 and the leaders of Comcast’s Entrepreneurial Engagement team were in the audience. Comcast-NBCUniversal was the sponsor of the Millennial Trains Project and was looking to send an entrepreneur to represent the city of Philadelphia. I met with the team at Comcast the week after demo day and they asked me if I wanted to participate in the Millennial Trains Project. The trip started a week later, two days after graduation. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n**I love how this huge experience came out of one chance encounter — it’s so spontaneous! How can students get themselves more out there at school?**\\n\\nWhen I was a sophomore, a female entrepreneur told me I should talk to someone new every day, so I started talking to everyone and anyone I could. I talked to a diverse group of individuals ranging from professors to government leaders to business executives to university administrators. You can learn something from everyone you meet and it is an entrepreneur’s job to build a community of experts. Meeting new people every day is my favorite part of being an entrepreneur.\\n\\n**Who were those people or communities for you at Penn?**\\n\\nPenn has a vibrant entrepreneurial community that consists of many support systems, including [Penn Wharton Entrepreneurship](https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/), [the Wharton Small Business Development Center](http://whartonsbdc.wharton.upenn.edu/), [the Wharton Innovation Fund](https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/innovation-fund/), [the Baker Retailing Center](https://bakerretail.wharton.upenn.edu/), [the Wharton Social Impact Initiative](https://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/), [the Detkin Intellectual Property & Technology Legal Clinic](https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/intellectualproperty/), and [the Entrepreneurship Legal Clinic](https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/entrepreneurship/). Every student entrepreneur needs to develop a roadmap that best suits her needs.\\n\\n![alt](https://pennpep.upenn.edu/uploads/files/299756209916459063-kg-reb-portrait.1099.0.2833.2833.one-half.jpg)\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n**For students who want to pursue social impact or entrepreneurship but may be disillusioned by how hard it is, what’s your advice to them to keep going?**\\n\\nI always say you need to swim upstream to be successful. While everyone is swimming in one direction and pursuing a common goal, you need to swim in the opposite direction. A mentor at the Wharton Small Business Development Center once told me to make sure that you always know your end goal and pursue opportunities that put you on the path to accomplishing that goal. If you don’t feel comfortable enough jumping in and being a full-time entrepreneur right away, you can identify the next best steps that will guide you along your startup journey. First, you should work in an industry that you are passionate about and will allow you to strengthen your expertise in a given field. Next, you can try working for an organization that mimics the environment of an early stage company, such as a startup accelerator, to learn the ins and outs of the business. Alternatively, you can also join a startup that has a more established team of about 200–300 people so you can learn gradually in a collaborative setting.\\n\\nA lot of people who love social impact or entrepreneurship take the safe route first, hoping to come back afterwards. But they don’t realize how much harder it is to make that 180-degree pivot after being so comfortable those two years. Any founder will tell you that there is not a specific class or job that will prepare you directly for your current venture. The only way to learn is to jump in and “just do it,” as Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, would say. \\n>==*Discomfort is the impetus of growth and once you become comfortable, it is time to start doing something new.==*\\n\\n**That’s a good rule of thumb. Two years is definitely not something to casually spend. You grew from 200 users that summer to 75,000 users now in just two years!**\\n\\nIn the startup world, a month can seem like a lifetime because everything moves so quickly. Every day counts when you are building a company and every task is pursued with a sense of urgency. As long as you are learning and growing from your work, it will provide you with valuable experience you can apply to any profession.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"4\\\"></div>\\n**What are the biggest misconceptions about being an entrepreneur?**\\n\\nI think that people perceive being an entrepreneur to be a lot more glamorous than it really is. When we are on the road over the summer, my team and I work 20-hour days across three different time zones. Successful companies are not built over night; it requires an unwavering commitment to building something you truly believe in. If you like living in a state of constant change, being an entrepreneur will provide you with a fun and fulfilling career.\\n\\n**Lastly, what are your favorite books or pieces of media?**\\n\\nI love reading the autobiographies of successful entrepreneurs. My current favorites are Shoe Dog by Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, and It Takes a Tribe: Building the Tough Mudder Movement, by Will Dean, the founder of Tough Mudder.\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Katlyn Grasso is the CEO and founder of GenHERation, a startup that connects young women to companies through nationwide events and a digital platform.

Her other accomplishments include being selected to participate in\nthe 2015 Millennial Trains Project, a cross country trip for social innovators\nfrom around the world to connect and build out their ideas. At Penn, Katlyn took\nadvantage of several entrepreneurship resources to help her grow GenHERation.\nRead her interview below to learn more.\n\n\n\nStories worth noting:\n<tr>\n    <td>1)</td>      \n    <td>Balancing entrepreneurship and full-time studies at Wharton</td>\n\n\nRead\n\n 2)  \n Becoming a better entrepreneur by meeting new people every dayRead\n 3)  \n Katlyn's advice about \"swimming upstream\" to be successfulRead</tr>\n\n\n4)  \n Common misconceptions about being an entrepreneurRead\n **You worked on GenHERation for most of your time at Penn. How did you balance\nthat with your studies at Wharton?**Being an entrepreneur requires a certain set\nof skills, including persistence, determination, and resilience. It’s something\nthat is tied to your identity and it is certainly not a 9-to-5 job. It’s a 24/7\nmentality for me. College is the best time to be an entrepreneur because there\nis an abundance of resources available for students. There are business plan\ncompetitions, grants, research stipends, and fellowships. There are many people\nwho want to help student entrepreneurs succeed and student founders are tasked\nwith finding the best way to navigate the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\nOne issue I see is a lot of people have ideas but it’s hard to decide whether\nit’s worth taking on full-time or to keep it as just a side project. What\nconvinced you to pursue GenHERation full-time?\n\nAt the end of my junior summer, before the President’s Engagement Prize was\nannounced, I knew I was going to be an entrepreneur full-time after graduation.\nI received the Wharton Venture Award, which provides $10,000 to rising seniors\nor second year MBAs to pursue their own venture the summer before their last\nyear of school. At the end of that summer, we had hosted a five-city Summer\nLeadership Series and grew from 200 to 5,000 users. I thought if we could\nachieve these milestones during a three-month period, imagine what we could do\nwhen we’re working on the startup full time!\n\nLet’s shift to the Millennial Trains Project you were in while still in school.\nThe premise is so unique — tell us about it.\n\nThe Millennial Trains Project (MTP) was a transformational experience. MTP is a\ncross-country train trip for millennial leaders working to advance social impact\nprojects around the world. My cohort traveled from Los Angeles to Washington,\nD.C. over the course of ten days while visiting historical landmarks along the\nway. The participants on the train were some of the most inspiring people I have\never met and continue to be an active group of change-makers. The Millennial\nTrains Project helped me recognize the power of travel and its ability to create\nnew communities.\n\nHow did you first hear about the Millennial Trains Project?\n\nI was at a demo day for Wharton Entrepreneurship in the spring of 2015 and the\nleaders of Comcast’s Entrepreneurial Engagement team were in the audience.\nComcast-NBCUniversal was the sponsor of the Millennial Trains Project and was\nlooking to send an entrepreneur to represent the city of Philadelphia. I met\nwith the team at Comcast the week after demo day and they asked me if I wanted\nto participate in the Millennial Trains Project. The trip started a week later,\ntwo days after graduation.\n\n**I love how this huge experience came out of one chance encounter — it’s so\nspontaneous! How can students get themselves more out there at school?**When I\nwas a sophomore, a female entrepreneur told me I should talk to someone new\nevery day, so I started talking to everyone and anyone I could. I talked to a\ndiverse group of individuals ranging from professors to government leaders to\nbusiness executives to university administrators. You can learn something from\neveryone you meet and it is an entrepreneur’s job to build a community of\nexperts. Meeting new people every day is my favorite part of being an\nentrepreneur.\n\nWho were those people or communities for you at Penn?\n\nPenn has a vibrant entrepreneurial community that consists of many support\nsystems, including Penn Wharton Entrepreneurship\n[https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/], the Wharton Small Business\nDevelopment Center [http://whartonsbdc.wharton.upenn.edu/], the Wharton\nInnovation Fund [https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/innovation-fund/], \nthe Baker Retailing Center [https://bakerretail.wharton.upenn.edu/], the\nWharton\nSocial Impact Initiative [https://socialimpact.wharton.upenn.edu/], the Detkin\nIntellectual Property & Technology Legal Clinic\n[https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/intellectualproperty/], and the\nEntrepreneurship Legal Clinic\n[https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/entrepreneurship/]. Every student entrepreneur\nneeds to develop a roadmap that best suits her needs.\n\n\n\n**For students who want to pursue social impact or entrepreneurship but may be\ndisillusioned by how hard it is, what’s your advice to them to keep going?**I\nalways say you need to swim upstream to be successful. While everyone is\nswimming in one direction and pursuing a common goal, you need to swim in the\nopposite direction. A mentor at the Wharton Small Business Development Center\nonce told me to make sure that you always know your end goal and pursue\nopportunities that put you on the path to accomplishing that goal. If you don’t\nfeel comfortable enough jumping in and being a full-time entrepreneur right\naway, you can identify the next best steps that will guide you along your\nstartup journey. First, you should work in an industry that you are passionate\nabout and will allow you to strengthen your expertise in a given field. Next,\nyou can try working for an organization that mimics the environment of an early\nstage company, such as a startup accelerator, to learn the ins and outs of the\nbusiness. Alternatively, you can also join a startup that has a more established\nteam of about 200–300 people so you can learn gradually in a collaborative\nsetting.\n\nA lot of people who love social impact or entrepreneurship take the safe route\nfirst, hoping to come back afterwards. But they don’t realize how much harder it\nis to make that 180-degree pivot after being so comfortable those two years. Any\nfounder will tell you that there is not a specific class or job that will\nprepare you directly for your current venture. The only way to learn is to jump\nin and “just do it,” as Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, would say.\n\n*Discomfort is the impetus of growth and once you become comfortable, it is time\nto start doing something new.*\n\nThat’s a good rule of thumb. Two years is definitely not something to casually\nspend. You grew from 200 users that summer to 75,000 users now in just two\nyears!\n\nIn the startup world, a month can seem like a lifetime because everything moves\nso quickly. Every day counts when you are building a company and every task is\npursued with a sense of urgency. As long as you are learning and growing from\nyour work, it will provide you with valuable experience you can apply to any\nprofession.\n\n**What are the biggest misconceptions about being an entrepreneur?**I think that\npeople perceive being an entrepreneur to be a lot more glamorous than it really\nis. When we are on the road over the summer, my team and I work 20-hour days\nacross three different time zones. Successful companies are not built over\nnight; it requires an unwavering commitment to building something you truly\nbelieve in. If you like living in a state of constant change, being an\nentrepreneur will provide you with a fun and fulfilling career.\n\nLastly, what are your favorite books or pieces of media?\n\nI love reading the autobiographies of successful entrepreneurs. My current\nfavorites are Shoe Dog by Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, and It Takes a\nTribe: Building the Tough Mudder Movement, by Will Dean, the founder of Tough\nMudder.","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/10/GSK-Invitational-1.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Katlyn Grasso","meta_description":"Read about how Katlyn Grasso used her momentum from winning the President's Engagement Prize to build a national social impact organization.","author_id":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85b","created_at":"2017-10-02 05:00:52","created_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85b","updated_at":"2017-10-24 14:35:05","updated_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85d","published_at":"2017-10-02 05:00:00","published_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85d"},{"id":"5ba832145ee55800011ab92a","uuid":"124a5658-e290-4fe1-8604-352b97b34729","title":"Jenny Lefcourt on Dropping Out of Stanford Before It Was Cool (Part 1)","slug":"jenny-lefcourt-part-1","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Jenny Lefcourt is currently a partner at Freestyle Capital, a venture capital (VC) company with $216 million in funds and investments in over 89 companies to date.

While studying there, I worked on a business plan for WeddingChannel, more as a way to learn about venture capital and entrepreneurship than actually being that serious about our business. But as we worked more and more on it, we got very serious about it, believed in it, and once we got a term sheet from Kleiner Perkins at the end of our first year, I decided to drop out of business school and pursue that. *Editor’s note: A term sheet is a legal document denoting the financial agreements between the venture capital firm and the startup.

Since there’s a lot of smart people going down that path and so much capital available, you end up with a lot more noise.

Did you have that fear going in and what were the biggest challenges you had to face?**\\n\\nThe biggest challenges were what we were doing strategically. For example, Amazon.com had just gone public then and was doing really well. At the time, they were only selling books online and it makes sense that people would buy a book online because you know exactly what you're buying. There's no mystery because you don't need to touch and feel it. We asked ourselves what else has those attributes and decided wedding gifts are perfect.

The biggest challenge is getting the retailers to see our vision and work with a startup. They were giving us their incredible brands like Neiman Marcus and Crate and Barrel, all to create this new experience. The tech is obviously something that has to be created but it wasn't rocket science. We brought on a third co-founder who heads tech and had a giant tech team because back in the day, you had to build everything from scratch. I don't mean to say tech didn't matter. \\n>==But it really was the business model, the partnerships we created, and the experience we provided for the brides and grooms and their gift buyers that was going to make or break this business, not the technology that enabled it.==\\n\\n**Do you recommend that non-technical people still learn that technical side?**\\n\\nObviously that's a bonus. No matter what you're building, tech is going to be a big part of it. Even if you're not the one coding it or in charge of your engineers, understanding it is going to be positive. Do I think you must be technical in order to be successful? No, I do not. But I think then you have to be able to find someone that you know and trust who shares the same values, same leadership so that they can create the technology that supports the business that you're creating.\\n\\n**Stay tuned for [Part 2: Women in Venture Capital!](http://thesign.al/jenny-lefcourt-on-dropping-out-of-stanford-before-it-was-cool-part-2/)**\\n\\n***Editor’s Note:*** *I first met Jenny on the [Wharton San Francisco](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep-sf/) trip in January in which she told us her story, along with several other alums.

She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of\nBusiness in 1991 and started working for a big company in New York City before\nbecoming “disillusioned with corporate life.” After a year of backpacking around\nthe world, she moved to Palo Alto and have since been “hooked on the Valley way\n— combine big ideas, smart people, hard work, and a little bit of luck and great\nthings will ensue.” Her adventures include dropping out of Stanford to co-found\nher first company, WeddingChannel.com [http://WeddingChannel.com], a\ngift-registry aggregator; starting another named Bella Pictures; and attending\nthe Circus Center in San Francisco for contortionism.\n\nStories worth noting:\n1)  \n From accounting to backpacking around the world to startups.Read\n 2)  \n Dropping out of Stanford before it was cool.Read\n 3)  \n Why business is crucial in the tech world.Read</tr>\n\n\nYou started off in accounting and you mentioned it wasn't enough. Why did you\nchoose to go into accounting and then how you made the shift to\nentrepreneurship?\n\nFrom being a Wharton undergrad and having a concentration in accounting to\ncoming from a family of CPAs (Certified Public Accountants), it felt like a very\nresponsible path to go down, a failsafe I could fall back on. All the firms come\nto campus and give you offers — it's so easy. So I followed the path of least\nresistance. I remember actually crying before I started, saying, \"Why did I do\nthis? I know this is not what I want to do.\" But here I was.\n\nIt was not the job for me. I wish I could tell you that I learned so much, that\nit was amazing. In the first few years as an auditor, you're not supposed to\nthink. The general consensus is “what we did last year is what we do this year.”\n\nI worked two years to the day, quit, and went off to backpack around the world\nwith a friend with no idea what I wanted to do. I just knew I had to close that\ndoor because life's too short.\n\nWhen I returned to the states, my boyfriend — now husband — was at Stanford. I\nwent to their career center and — this is pre-Internet — looked through every\nbinder of jobs. I took down jobs in nonprofits, teaching — you name it. I had no\nidea what to do, but the job descriptions in Silicon Valley sounded so fun, so I\napplied to work at a software company as a junior marketer. I remember at the\ninterview, I was having conversations with some of the smartest people I had\never met, but they were all wearing shorts and T-shirts and I was blown away.\n\nI really loved that job. It was a meritocracy. The more you were willing to do,\nthe more they were willing to give you. It was the first time that I had\nexperienced how I want to work. I did that for three years, then went to the\nStanford Graduate Business School in 1997. While studying there, I worked on a\nbusiness plan for WeddingChannel, more as a way to learn about venture capital\nand entrepreneurship than actually being that serious about our business. But as\nwe worked more and more on it, we got very serious about it, believed in it, and\nonce we got a term sheet from Kleiner Perkins at the end of our first year, I\ndecided to drop out of business school and pursue that. Editor’s note: A term\nsheet is a legal document denoting the financial agreements between the venture\ncapital firm and the startup. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) is a\nleading venture capital company.\n\nThat must have been quite a leap of faith to drop out of Stanford to pursue\nthat! Was there a specific moment in which you actually knew WeddingChannel was\na winner?\n\nThe moment we got a term sheet and got funding, there was no question. People\nsay, \"God that must have been so hard,\" and I know it sounds unbelievable — but\nit just wasn't that hard.\n\nI went to business school to have doors open. They just opened up early. My\nco-founder and I sat there asking ourselves, “So should we?” and we're both\nlike, “Yeah.” It was a no-brainer for us.\n\nI remember going to the Dean — this is before people regularly dropped out of\nbusiness school — and we explained, \"Hey, we would love to pursue this. Now\nthere's a chance it won't work out, and if it doesn't, we would love to come\nback.” And he said, “If you want to come back, it's because you failed, and we\ndon't want failures here.” We're like, “Well, that wraps it up!” They have\nchanged the policy since, as they realized too much is going on in the world and\nthe dot-com era called upon too many people, so they got a lot more flexible.\nBut since we were first, they were not prepared for that. I still have a great\nrelationship with Stanford: I love that school, I speak there, I give there.\nIt's all good.\n\nThat's surprising to hear “we don’t want failures here” was Stanford’s attitude\nback then in 1997. Now, failure seems to be encouraged in the Valley.\n\nYeah, it's a very different world that we're in now. He had said to us, \"Listen,\nif it’s that good of a business, it'll still be here in a year [once you\ngraduate],\" and we're like, \"No, it won't.\" Here's an opportunity that we think\nis a perfect application for purchasing on the Internet. It won't be here in a\nyear — someone will take it. This was a new phenomenon back then. Now, you don’t\nhave the luxury of time.\n\nSo comparing your time as a founder during the dot-com era vs as a venture\ncapitalist now, what do you think has changed in how people approach\nentrepreneurship?\n\nNow, everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. It's the hip thing to do, but it's\nreally not for everyone. The media glamorizes it, but it's hard as hell. It's\nlonely, it's grueling, it takes a lot out of you. The people who did it back in\nthe day really had a vision and really couldn't carry on without it coming to\nfruition or at least trying.\n\nNow people are saying, \"Oh, I really want to start something,\" and then they try\nto come up with ideas. Since there’s a lot of smart people going down that path\nand so much capital available, you end up with a lot more noise. You get a lot\nof businesses that maybe shouldn't be funded because they're not meant to be big\nbusinesses or there are five other people doing the same thing. But people will\nfund them because there's so much capital.\n\n\nJenny Lefcourt has served as a startup pitch judge at TechCrunch Disrupt since\n2016.\n\nYou started off in business and then founded an internet startup. At Penn, I\ncan't even tell you the number of students who have asked, \"I only know\nbusiness. What does the tech world really see in me?\" They have this fear that\nthey aren’t valued as much or that they can't do much there. Did you have that\nfear going in and what were the biggest challenges you had to face?\n\nThe biggest challenges were what we were doing strategically. For example, \nAmazon.com [http://Amazon.com]  had just gone public then and was doing really\nwell. At the time, they were only selling books online and it makes sense that\npeople would buy a book online because you know exactly what you're buying.\nThere's no mystery because you don't need to touch and feel it. We asked\nourselves what else has those attributes and decided wedding gifts are perfect.\nIf you put a vase on your on your registry and it's the right price point for\nme, I don't need to touch and feel it. You already picked it out and I just need\nto buy it for you.\n\nThoroughly understanding the customer, and understanding how the market should\nwork was essential. The biggest challenge is getting the retailers to see our\nvision and work with a startup. They were giving us their incredible brands like\nNeiman Marcus and Crate and Barrel, all to create this new experience. The tech\nis obviously something that has to be created but it wasn't rocket science. We\nbrought on a third co-founder who heads tech and had a giant tech team because\nback in the day, you had to build everything from scratch. I don't mean to say\ntech didn't matter.\n\nBut it really was the business model, the partnerships we created, and the\nexperience we provided for the brides and grooms and their gift buyers that was\ngoing to make or break this business, not the technology that enabled it.\n\nDo you recommend that non-technical people still learn that technical side?\n\nObviously that's a bonus. No matter what you're building, tech is going to be a\nbig part of it. Even if you're not the one coding it or in charge of your\nengineers, understanding it is going to be positive. Do I think you must be\ntechnical in order to be successful? No, I do not. But I think then you have to\nbe able to find someone that you know and trust who shares the same values, same\nleadership so that they can create the technology that supports the business\nthat you're creating.\n\nStay tuned for Part 2: Women in Venture Capital!\n[http://thesign.al/jenny-lefcourt-on-dropping-out-of-stanford-before-it-was-cool-part-2/]\n\nEditor’s Note:  I first met Jenny on the Wharton San Francisco\n[https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep-sf/]  trip in January in which\nshe told us her story, along with several other alums.

I thought it was a great step to get both the engineering and computer science knowledge and some business acumen as well. \\n\\n**Any clubs or work you did during college that you found was really interesting or helped you grow a lot?** \\n \\nI had a senior thesis on information security that had nothing to do with what I do now, but I think it's really just learning to think in different ways. I've always been on the business side of startups, but having the engineering knowledge helps you communicate with engineers and understand the scope and complexity of technical challenges in a project without having to consult other people. \\n \\n**How did having the engineering background teach you to approach problems differently?** \\n \\nI approach everything with a very engineering or systems-based approach. It's useful in tech and a lot of different jobs, but it's *not* the only thing that you need. Penn prepared me well on the engineering, technical, and business skills. But, there are a lot of **soft skills**, social skills, like knowing how to sell. Those are skills that a lot of universities shy away from. Nobody wants to be known as a salesperson or someone who cold calls. But those are skills that are very useful in almost anything else you do ([more here]()). \\n<div id=\\\"sell\\\"></div>\\nI was a CEO of a start-up, and I *sold* smart people to try to join me as employees, I *sold* investors to try to get money, I *sold* partners to work with us when we were too small to really make a difference to their bottom line. A lot of entrepreneurship is just selling stuff. It's something that you have to learn on your own.\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div> \\n**A lot of us don't know where we're going or we feel pressure from our parents or peers. What would you say to someone trying to figure out their path?** \\n \\nI think a good start is to find your strengths. This is something Facebook says, and I totally agree with it:\\n >==*Our strengths are things that you find joy and energy doing.*== \\n\\nIt might not necessarily be the things that you are actually best at. You might be really good at cranking Excel, but you may find that it's draining and you don't actually enjoy it. Maybe there are other things, like programming or data analysis, where you're like, “I'm actually in-flow. I don't feel tired because I want to do it.”\\n \\nAlso seek out [career counseling](www.upenn.edu/careerservices/). I feel like Wharton only teaches you so much, and doesn't really tell you anything about careers other than 80 percent of people go into financial or consulting. \\n\\n>==*I wish I knew exactly what I was getting into, what the job would entail, what I’d learn, what the earning potential was. You can really can get this information from talking to [anyone 25 or older in these industries](https://quakernet.alumni.upenn.edu/).*==\\n\\nI joined the *one* startup that recruited at Penn that year ([Snapfish](www.snapfish.com/)). I could have been more proactive about learning the type of role and the type of company I'm most interested in. \\n<div id =\\\"summer\\\"></div> \\nPeople now are getting relevant business experience significantly earlier than I did. \\n>==*My first summer in college, I was waiting tables at a Mexican restaurant. The next one I was selling cell phones at AT&T. It didn't even occur to me that I needed to learn about all these industries that early.*==\\n \\n**What do you think you learned at Snapfish, since that was right after you graduated college?**\\n\\nI think there's a lot of just maturity and polish. I don't want to say it's one specific thing, just like if you take the same smart person when they're 20, 27, 32. The core's the same, the intelligence is there, the attitude is similar, but everything just gets a bit better. \\n>==*The way that you communicate gets better, your critical thinking gets better, your confidence in your opinions and what you're supposed to do gets better. Being in as many different environments as possible helps that out.*== \\n\\n**So you worked at a startup in San Francisco and later founded a startup in New York. Could you talk about the differences in the startup culture between those cities?**\\n \\nThere are many. After Penn, I went straight to San Francisco to work for a startup called Snapfish. At the time, only a couple of kids my year actually went to SF. Everyone did consulting or finance and moved to New York — it's just what everyone did. So I was very excited to try it. \\n\\nFor early stage tech, NY tech is growing very fast, but it's still a significantly smaller market size than San Francisco. In San Francisco, you just have more access to networks of everything: more smart engineers, angel investors and venture capitalists, experienced people that could be advisors, mentors, or board members. It's a better place to learn and grow. \\n \\n>==*So if I were to start a company with no other knowledge, I'd probably say San Francisco, but it's balanced against the fact that New York may be a more interesting place to live.*== \\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n**What made you go to London and do you recommend that people get experience abroad?** \\n \\nI moved overseas for an online gambling startup because, legally, an executive of the company had to be based offshore to get an online gambling license outside the US. The startup scene there is much smaller. Before I moved to London, I spent six years in San Francisco, and it was the only place I knew as an adult. \\n>==*I was really scared of moving out of the country. **It ended up being one of the best years of my life.** I knew I should have totally done this, that I should have done [study abroad](global.upenn.edu/pennabroad). I'm very bullish on it from a personal growth experience.*==\\n \\nI was scared that I would miss out on stuff in San Francisco, but the truth is, there's not much you're missing out. Moving to another place stretches you and enables you to make new friends, but it doesn't mean your old friends go away. So I highly encourage it as a personal growth experience. \\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div> \\n**So after London and after working on that startup, what led you to start [Locality](https://locality.com/)?** \\n \\nI finally just decided it was time to do it. Looking back, I would probably have done it sooner. There are certainly things that you learn at companies — not to discount that. But there's just so much more you learn about entrepreneurship through actually doing it. Like, the first time you realize, “I can't make payroll,\\\" and I have to tell my employees they're not getting paid. I had multiple situations being a week away from telling our employees that we're running out of money, and you always end up raising money right at the last second. \\n \\nSo I would say don't overvalue prior experience. If you feel like you have a good idea and you're excited to test it out, you don't need ten years of experience to do a startup. \\n \\n**Through your experience of running Locality what was most exciting about it, and what did you gain most from doing the startup?** \\n \\nYou get to learn all the different challenges at each stage of the business. It develops your self-confidence by putting you in stressful situations, forcing you to present to people. You have to develop huge confidence without freaking out or over-worrying. \\n \\nFunctionally it just forces you to think very methodically; there's a startup way of thinking that is different from a big company. At a startup, you are under-resourced, so you have to be very selective about what you do. What's the minimal amount of work that you can do, the smallest thing you can build that gives you *signal* on whether it's the right path or not? \\n\\n*Read on for Jay's advice on convincing, his move to Facebook, and his favorite blog and news sites.

Right after college, he moved to San\nFrancisco to join the only startup that recruited at Penn, Snapfish.

I thought it\nwas a great step to get both the engineering and computer science knowledge and\nsome business acumen as well.\n\nAny clubs or work you did during college that you found was really interesting\nor helped you grow a lot?\n\nI had a senior thesis on information security that had nothing to do with what I\ndo now, but I think it's really just learning to think in different ways. I've\nalways been on the business side of startups, but having the engineering\nknowledge helps you communicate with engineers and understand the scope and\ncomplexity of technical challenges in a project without having to consult other\npeople.\n\nHow did having the engineering background teach you to approach problems\ndifferently?\n\nI approach everything with a very engineering or systems-based approach. It's\nuseful in tech and a lot of different jobs, but it's not  the only thing that\nyou need. Penn prepared me well on the engineering, technical, and business\nskills. But, there are a lot of soft skills, social skills, like knowing how to\nsell. Those are skills that a lot of universities shy away from. Nobody wants to\nbe known as a salesperson or someone who cold calls. But those are skills that\nare very useful in almost anything else you do (more here).\n\nI was a CEO of a start-up, and I *sold* smart people to try to join me as\nemployees, I *sold* investors to try to get money, I *sold* partners to work\nwith us when we were too small to really make a difference to their bottom line.\nA lot of entrepreneurship is just selling stuff. It's something that you have to\nlearn on your own.  \n**A lot of us don't know where we're going or we feel pressure from our parents\nor peers. What would you say to someone trying to figure out their path?**I\nthink a good start is to find your strengths. This is something Facebook says,\nand I totally agree with it:\n\nOur strengths are things that you find joy and energy doing.\n\nIt might not necessarily be the things that you are actually best at. You might\nbe really good at cranking Excel, but you may find that it's draining and you\ndon't actually enjoy it. Maybe there are other things, like programming or data\nanalysis, where you're like, “I'm actually in-flow. I don't feel tired because I\nwant to do it.”\n\nAlso seek out career counseling [www.upenn.edu/careerservices/].

At Penn, I majored in Creative Writing - which is ostensibly useless unless you want to be a writer or a professor — and I minored in psychology and marketing. But my extracurricular side was entirely business-oriented. I think balance is really important. My predominant activity at Penn was the [Ivy Council](https://www.ivycouncil.org/). At the time, it was more of a student consortium, but I resurrected it from obscurity. My favorite thing to do, and probably my greatest skill, is building something from nothing. \\n\\nWhen I graduated, it was the height of the economic recession. Around 40 percent of my peers were unemployed, which is unheard of coming from an Ivy League school. I was very lucky. My dream since childhood was to be the next Walt Disney, and I basically had two choices. One is I could go down the traditional media path, in which I write, produce, direct, and star; or, I could go learn how to build a system. \\n\\nSo, I went to Google [to build a system]. I ended up being the only person from Penn to get an offer into Google’s Executive Management program. I created what the world now knows is the multibillion dollar influencer ecosystem at YouTube. I left about three years ago and now own two of my own companies: one is a tech company and the other is a content studio that’s launching later this year. Around 70 percent of my time is invested in launching my content studio, which is my childhood dream, and 20 percent of my time is investing in advising digital media companies. And then finally 10 percent of my time is spent community-building, focused on making the Asian community more cohesive and influential.\\n\\n<img src= \\\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-10-11-Bing1.jpeg\\\" alt=\\\"Bing Chen at YouTube\\\" style=\\\"width:80%;height:80%;\\\"vertical-align:middle\\\"> *<p align=\\\"center\\\">Bing Chen at YouTube. Source: Huffington Post.</p>*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n**What made you want to do creative writing?** \\n\\nI am absolutely thrilled that I did creative writing; it was probably the most useful thing I could have done. I, like everyone else in the liberal arts school, thought I needed to go to Wharton to get a job and gain useful skills. But, my advisor told me to look fundamentally at how you operate and think as a person, and then find a major that best suits that. \\n\\nThe problem with majoring in something too practical when you're 18 to 22 is that you’re compartmentalizing yourself in a box before you've even figured out what you want to put in a box. And ever since I was young, I really gravitated towards abstraction and metaphysical ideas. There are very few majors that enable you to leverage abstraction and make it into something useful. \\n\\nSecondarily, if you look at the people who run the entertainment industry, the overwhelming percentage of them majored in English. The third reason was the fact that there's always graduate school and the real world. \\n\\n>==Finding the opportunity to engage in real liberal arts in the real world is much harder, whereas you absolutely have an opportunity in finance and operations. You better milk these four years because you literally will not get an opportunity again to engage in something like this.== \\n\\nThe final reason was that it was really easy. There were nine to ten classes, and I know it sounds like a lazy comment, but one of the reasons I chose Penn was because it’s so *interdisciplinary*. Elon Musk is one of the best examples of an output of interdisciplinary thinking. So I took a lot of psychology, marketing, East Asian Studies, and politics classes — and I would not have been able to do that if I were in a dual degree program or in a more rigid major. It gave me the flexibility to do that. How do I use that today? I use my English major in the way I think every single day, every single second. English is really about creating something from scratch, and doing it in a really compelling way. \\n\\n<img src= \\\"https://edtosavetheworld.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/interdisciplinary-learning.png\\\" alt=\\\"Interdiscplinary\\\" style=\\\"width:50%;height:50%;\\\"vertical-align:middle\\\"> *<p align=\\\"center\\\"> Source: edtosavetheworld.com.</p>*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n**How did you make the fact that you were an English major, and not in Wharton, an advantage?**\\n\\nI did OCR (On-Campus Recruiting) in the fall because I wanted to try it and be exposed to that world. I did not get an interview for Google. But, the day of interviews, you can submit a cover letter and resume, and if someone drops out, Google calls you and gives you a few hours to prepare to interview. I was a back-up. I walked into the room, and it's all my marketing and management friends. One of them benevolently said, “What are you doing here?”\\n\\nThat fall semester, I was the *only one* to be accepted into the Executive Management program at Google. Usually the entering class for that program is 30 people, but due to the recession, it was 7. So not only was it competitive at Penn, but, globally, it was even more competitive. And I got in as an English major. If you look and sound like everyone else, then you will be suffocated by everyone else and you will disappear. Companies, especially companies that are as progressive as Google, want distinct thinkers. \\n\\n>==Across tech and media, increasingly your major has little to nothing to do with what you end up doing when you graduate. In the end, it's much more about how you think and if you can deliver.== \\n\\n\\n<img src=\\\"http://sites.psu.edu/prisrclblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/660/2013/02/pic-1.gif\\\" alt=\\\"English Major\\\" style=\\\"width:60%;height:60%;\\\"vertical-align:middle\\\"> *<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\\"Perks of Being an English Major\\\" Comic by Jacob Andrews. Source: ForLackofABetterComic.com.</p>*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n**What is something you think most students overlook when they’re at Penn?**\\n\\n>==Number one: take advantage of the professors.== \\n\\nI was getting more advice for creative business with professors at Penn. People forget that the professors at Penn are world-class experts in their field. They have incredible connections and the reality is that they are incentivized to help you as you are a talented person. They want to find the next person to lead. When you start in college, have them be like advisers. \\n\\n>==Secondly, I wish I started a business in college.==\\n\\n*Editor's note: Some Penn resources for starting a business can be found [here](https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/get-started/).*\\n\\nI know everyone thinks, “Oh I'm so exhausted, it's been so hard.” But the real world is ten times worse. So if there is ever the time to try something new, whether it's to write a play or start a business, it’s college. I took four or five classes for most semesters because I wanted to do other stuff, and I think that was great. (*Editor's note: Check out this article on [how to start a startup at Penn](https://medium.com/@dormroomfund/how-to-start-a-startup-the-university-of-pennsylvania-9784c1d141b2).*)\\n\\nThere’s also this thing called the [Counseling and Psychological Services](https://www.vpul.upenn.edu/caps/appointment.php), and I say all Penn students should go there. It's FREE. The majority of people who went to class are those who are just high-achieving people who are stressed out. They're not people who are suicidal or have bipolar disorder and I'm not trying to say that people are crazy because we're all crazy. But again, people are high-achievers who are just exhausted. \\n\\n>==Going to CAPS can help shape an amazing foundation psychologically for you before you enter the real world.== \\n\\nThere are a lot of hidden resources. There are a lot of [fellowships](https://www.curf.upenn.edu/fellowships). There are a lot of [research grants](https://www.curf.upenn.edu/research-grants). A lot of hacking competitions and programs (like [PennApps](http://pennapps.com/)). So you can leverage this for your own company, play, or project. Now I want it to be very clear about this — I'm not saying you need to join an organization. In fact, most of them are only useful for making new friends, which is useful but not the result. \\n\\n>==There are a lot of programs that most people don't know about, or whatever that’s useful to you when you start your own thing. It's simply a matter of asking where those are, and taking advantage of them.==\\n\\n**Read on for [Part 2](http://thesign.al/bing-chen-on-the-penn-experience-part-ii/): Bing's favorite professors at Penn and how he dealt with pressure from his parents.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Header photo courtesy of Bing Chen's [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/BingChen).*\\n\\n[![](/content/images/2017/02/mail-icon-wide-white-7.png)](mailto:writers+bing_chen1@thesign.al)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Bing Chen is a creator and entrepreneur who currently runs his own content studio company, Bing Studios.

At Penn, I majored in Creative Writing - which is ostensibly useless unless you want to be a writer or a professor — and I minored in psychology and marketing. But my extracurricular side was entirely business-oriented. I think balance is really important. My predominant activity at Penn was the <a href=\"https://www.ivycouncil.org/\">Ivy Council</a>. At the time, it was more of a student consortium, but I resurrected it from obscurity. My favorite thing to do, and probably my greatest skill, is building something from nothing.</p>\n<p>When I graduated, it was the height of the economic recession. Around 40 percent of my peers were unemployed, which is unheard of coming from an Ivy League school. I was very lucky. My dream since childhood was to be the next Walt Disney, and I basically had two choices. One is I could go down the traditional media path, in which I write, produce, direct, and star; or, I could go learn how to build a system.</p>\n<p>So, I went to Google [to build a system]. I ended up being the only person from Penn to get an offer into Google’s Executive Management program. I created what the world now knows is the multibillion dollar influencer ecosystem at YouTube. I left about three years ago and now own two of my own companies: one is a tech company and the other is a content studio that’s launching later this year. Around 70 percent of my time is invested in launching my content studio, which is my childhood dream, and 20 percent of my time is investing in advising digital media companies. And then finally 10 percent of my time is spent community-building, focused on making the Asian community more cohesive and influential.</p>\n<p>&lt;img src= &quot;<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-10-11-Bing1.jpeg\">http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-10-11-Bing1.jpeg</a>&quot; alt=&quot;Bing Chen at YouTube&quot; style=&quot;width:80%;height:80%;&quot;vertical-align:middle&quot;&gt; <em><p align=\"center\">Bing Chen at YouTube.

I, like everyone else in the liberal arts school, thought I needed to go to Wharton to get a job and gain useful skills. But, my advisor told me to look fundamentally at how you operate and think as a person, and then find a major that best suits that.</p>\n<p>The problem with majoring in something too practical when you're 18 to 22 is that you’re compartmentalizing yourself in a box before you've even figured out what you want to put in a box. And ever since I was young, I really gravitated towards abstraction and metaphysical ideas. There are very few majors that enable you to leverage abstraction and make it into something useful.</p>\n<p>Secondarily, if you look at the people who run the entertainment industry, the overwhelming percentage of them majored in English. The third reason was the fact that there's always graduate school and the real world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>Finding the opportunity to engage in real liberal arts in the real world is much harder, whereas you absolutely have an opportunity in finance and operations. You better milk these four years because you literally will not get an opportunity again to engage in something like this.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The final reason was that it was really easy. There were nine to ten classes, and I know it sounds like a lazy comment, but one of the reasons I chose Penn was because it’s so <em>interdisciplinary</em>. Elon Musk is one of the best examples of an output of interdisciplinary thinking. So I took a lot of psychology, marketing, East Asian Studies, and politics classes — and I would not have been able to do that if I were in a dual degree program or in a more rigid major. It gave me the flexibility to do that. How do I use that today? I use my English major in the way I think every single day, every single second. English is really about creating something from scratch, and doing it in a really compelling way.</p>\n<p>&lt;img src= &quot;<a href=\"https://edtosavetheworld.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/interdisciplinary-learning.png\">https://edtosavetheworld.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/interdisciplinary-learning.png</a>&quot; alt=&quot;Interdiscplinary&quot; style=&quot;width:50%;height:50%;&quot;vertical-align:middle&quot;&gt; <em><p align=\"center\"> Source: <a href=\"http://edtosavetheworld.com\">edtosavetheworld.com</a>.</p></em></p>\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n**How did you make the fact that you were an English major, and not in Wharton, an advantage?**\n<p>I did OCR (On-Campus Recruiting) in the fall because I wanted to try it and be exposed to that world.

Did you come into Penn with that in mind?**\\n \\nEver since I was a kid, I was always involved in theater doing plays and writing things and directing and producing. Simultaneously, I always loved movies. The first movie I ever saw in the movie theater was *The Champ* with Ricky Schroder and Jon Voight. It's a boxing movie, and that has a direct correlation to wanting to figure out how to do a boxing movie and finding the passion of a boxing movie. It was the first movie that I really remember seeing in the theater that I was like, \\\"Holy cow, like, that's possible? Maybe that's a job that someone can do, and if those kids are doing it, why can't I do it?\\\" — was the Goonies. It was this group of kids on this great adventure, and I was like \\\"God, those kids at my age. They're doing — they're working in that movie. That's incredible!\\\" It became the inspiration behind my movie, *The Fighter*. \\n \\nUltimately, that was really inspirational to me and I figured I wanted a career in that. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, where film was not really a big industry back then. Also, at the time there was no internet so you didn't know how to navigate anything. So coming into Penn, I knew I always loved entertainment and I always loved theater and movies, but there weren't really film classes here. Now, fortunately, there's a lot of new film programming. *Editor's note: Check out Penn's Cinema Studies (CIMS) department.*\\n \\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n\\nWhile I didn't formally study [film], I did find Mask and Wig, an on-campus comedy group. I had a great time with those guys - writing, directing, acting, singing — all that stuff. It was inspirational and there certainly is a direct correlation from that to figuring out a way to get to Los Angeles and the film business. The first real job that I ever had in Los Angeles was working as an assistant for a Mask and Wig guy ten years before me after meeting him at a Mask & Wig reunion. I spent an extraordinary amount of time in Mask and Wig and had a high level of dedication to it. It shaped and continued to cultivate my creative desires. *Editor's note: Take a look at the Fall 1994 Mask & Wig show Todd was involved in, \\\"[Carpe Stouffer: Seize the Tray](http://archive.maskandwig.com/Undergraduate%20Productions/1994%20Carpe%20Stouffer/Carpe%20Stouffer%20-%20Program.pdf)\\\"!*\\n \\nBut the movie business was always an enigma.

For a movie like *The Fighter*, I think of that rousing third act and feeling the energy of the crowd. But in a drama, I'll look for someone wiping their eyes.

Did you come into Penn with that in mind?</strong></p>\n<p>Ever since I was a kid, I was always involved in theater doing plays and writing things and directing and producing. Simultaneously, I always loved movies. The first movie I ever saw in the movie theater was <em>The Champ</em> with Ricky Schroder and Jon Voight. It's a boxing movie, and that has a direct correlation to wanting to figure out how to do a boxing movie and finding the passion of a boxing movie. It was the first movie that I really remember seeing in the theater that I was like, &quot;Holy cow, like, that's possible? Maybe that's a job that someone can do, and if those kids are doing it, why can't I do it?&quot; — was the Goonies. It was this group of kids on this great adventure, and I was like &quot;God, those kids at my age. They're doing — they're working in that movie. That's incredible!&quot; It became the inspiration behind my movie, <em>The Fighter</em>.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, that was really inspirational to me and I figured I wanted a career in that. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, where film was not really a big industry back then. Also, at the time there was no internet so you didn't know how to navigate anything. So coming into Penn, I knew I always loved entertainment and I always loved theater and movies, but there weren't really film classes here. Now, fortunately, there's a lot of new film programming. <em>Editor's note: Check out Penn's Cinema Studies (CIMS) department.</em></p>\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n<p>While I didn't formally study [film], I did find Mask and Wig, an on-campus comedy group. I had a great time with those guys - writing, directing, acting, singing — all that stuff. It was inspirational and there certainly is a direct correlation from that to figuring out a way to get to Los Angeles and the film business. The first real job that I ever had in Los Angeles was working as an assistant for a Mask and Wig guy ten years before me after meeting him at a Mask &amp; Wig reunion. I spent an extraordinary amount of time in Mask and Wig and had a high level of dedication to it. It shaped and continued to cultivate my creative desires. <em>Editor's note: Take a look at the Fall 1994 Mask &amp; Wig show Todd was involved in, &quot;<a href=\"http://archive.maskandwig.com/Undergraduate%20Productions/1994%20Carpe%20Stouffer/Carpe%20Stouffer%20-%20Program.pdf\">Carpe Stouffer: Seize the Tray</a>&quot;!</em></p>\n<p>But the movie business was always an enigma.

One is, I would get my hand on as many screenplays as possible and\ncontinually read. Plays and musicals are two-act structures. Movies are\nthree-act structures. I wasn't familiar with that so it took me many years to\ncultivate my taste, know structures, and understand how characters worked within\nthat.

My favorite part of producing is the discovery of a story, finding that\nnugget that you emotionally connect with and saying - 'Oh my gosh, I really want\nto make others see this the way I see it' - and then unveiling that vision.\nThere have been so many moments in which you sit in a room full of people and\nshow them a film that you're really proud of and see them collectively get moved\nby the experience. There's nothing like it.\n\n\nIs there a movie that most vividly stood out to you in that way?\n\nStronger  is really emblematic of that. There's an extraordinary amount of\nemotion and uplift that comes from this movie. If I've seen a movie multiple\ntimes, I don't watch the screen anymore, I just watch the crowd. In a comedy,\nyou know when something's working when you hear that uproar of laughter. For a\nmovie like The Proposal, I think of times when you can't hear the lines because\nthe laughter is so loud. For a movie like The Fighter, I think of that rousing\nthird act and feeling the energy of the crowd. But in a drama, I'll look for\nsomeone wiping their eyes. In this particular movie, Stronger, there are\nmultiple instances where you'll see hands go up to faces.\n\nSo on the flip side, what are some difficult moments you had as a producer?\n\nThe hard part about being a producer is that there isn't a specified job\ndescription. There isn't one particular thing that you are the best at so you\nhave to know a little bit about everything.\n\nThe challenge as a producer is knowing when it's my turn to step in and change\ndirection, while also having the confidence to step back and know that the\nprocess will figure itself out. It's like being the CEO of a mini-corporation.\n\nIt's managerial, but it's also very creative. It's no secret that there's a lot\nof personalities in the movie business, so my job involves balancing a lot of\ndifferent opinions. It's my job to corral that and make sure that everyone feels\ngood about the direction we're headed: everyone feels heard, no one feels\nostracized, and we're kind of a big family unit of many people moving forward to\na collective vision.\n\nAs a producer, you sometimes see tens or hundreds of scripts before you find the\nright one — the golden nugget. For you, how do you know?\n\nI make decisions — this is going to sound really corny — with my gut and heart\nrather than my head. I never tend to intellectualize or analyze something. I\ntruly go off of how it affects me. And that's really it. I guess people call\nthat a gut check.\n\nIf I'm laughing, tearing up, or feeling inspired, that signals to me that I\ncan't be the only one in the world who will feel that. That's kind of my\nbarometer.\n\nThere are a lot of jobs that have very clear-cut paths. Film can be the complete\nopposite sometimes. How did you have the confidence to know that this is what\nyou want to do?\n\nI wish I could call it confidence. At that time [at Penn], it really was\ncomplete naïveté. I was just going in blindly and thought \"oh, that sounds\ncool.\" Confidence in ignorance is what it was.\n\nI love the brutal honesty. How did you navigate that first year in Los Angeles?\n\nNot well.\n\nI had about 18,000 different jobs. I was on a television series, I was spraying\ncologne, I was a bartender, I was a bouncer, I was teaching at a Hebrew school.\nI was doing all kinds of things that were all over the place. I just kind of\nfigured my way out there.\n\nI didn't even know what producing was, frankly. I just knew that somehow,\nsomewhere I wanted to be involved in movies.\n\nHow did you keep yourself motivated?\n\nYou know, in retrospect, I suppose it should have been discouraging but it\nwasn't so. I remember very vividly just approaching it day-by-day rather than\nworrying about my long-term plans.\n\nIn the same way that I analyze scripts, the choices I make in my life either\nfeel good or don't feel good. I know that if I didn't feel like I was doing the\nright thing, I would have done something else.\n\nLastly, if your life was a movie that you're producing, what are the two main\nscenes so far that made you who you are today?\n\nWow, a very philosophical question.\n\nOne is my decision to move to LA. Though at the moment, it didn't feel like such\na big moment. It just felt like something I needed to do. But now, suddenly, I\nhave a family, a wife and two kids, and consider LA my home. It's very strange\nfor me to think that that is where I ended up.\n\nThe other one is the decision to go to Penn. The decision was a random one, in\nthe same way that everything else seems to be. We were on a college tour on the\nEast Coast, and my mom was the one who said we should stop at Penn. And I was\nlike, \"Ah, nah.\" But we were driving through on the way to Boston and so we\nstopped there anyway. I looked around the campus and I ended up meeting somebody\nwho happened to be the Midwest Regional Director of Admissions. We sat and\ntalked for two hours and in that moment, Penn became the place I was going to\ngo.\n\nThat decision informed basically all the rest of my decisions — the confidence\nto do Mask and Wig and meet all these different people, which enabled the\npassion to go to Los Angeles to make movies, and you know the rest.\n\nEditor’s Note:\nI was introduced to Todd by Matt Rosler, a former President of the Penn Club of\nLos Angeles and creator of Penntertainment [http://penntertainment.com/], a\ncommunity website for Penn students and alums interested in media &\nentertainment. Todd was hosting an advanced showing for his new movie, Stronger,\nwhen I introduced The Sign.al [http://Sign.al]  and our mission to him.\n\nHis story about not knowing what to do for years after graduating, working\nhundreds of odd jobs while still having faith that he was in the right place for\nthe right career, was incredibly inspiring. So many students worry that they\nwon’t have anything come senior year, but we forget to look past our narrow\nperspective. For Todd, it was never about the well-structured plan, but rather\nthe hustle and luck of getting yourself in the fray and letting life happen.","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/10/todd-lieberman-slice.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Todd Lieberman on \"Making It\" in Film Through Confidence in Ignorance","meta_description":"After years of working odd jobs and dealing with an uncertain path, Todd eventually found his dream job to produce movies like Beauty and the Beast.","author_id":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85b","created_at":"2017-10-21 01:12:49","created_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85f","updated_at":"2017-10-24 17:36:13","updated_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85b","published_at":"2017-10-24 14:40:19","published_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85d"},{"id":"5ba832145ee55800011ab92e","uuid":"653cbcd2-3012-4ae6-ba9d-2ceecb1f5761","title":"Gayle McDowell on Writing Code to Writing Books","slug":"gayle-mcdowell","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Gayle Laakmann McDowell is the founder and CEO of CareerCup.com and the author of the widely acclaimed \\\"Cracking\\\" career book series (Cracking the Coding Interview, Cracking the PM Interview, and Cracking the Tech Career).

How did you know you wanted to be a software engineer?**\\n\\nI knew since I started programming. My mother was an engineer who went to Penn Engineering as well, and she had forced me in high school to take one programming class before I graduated. I signed up and took it freshman year to get it out of the way, and ended up just really loving it. I loved building stuff and being able to create - it was just something that was very different. I feel like the rest of school was memorizing something, learning an equation, solving and applying it, and programming was something very different. It was actually constructing a design something new and that really appealed to me. \\n\\n**What prompted you to switch jobs?**\\n\\nI worked at Google for three years. It was a great experience, but I ultimately left because I didn't want to be a software developer full-time. I loved programming, but I liked being able to do more than one thing all day. So I left to join a start-up and then eventually started my own thing. \\n\\n**Is that what prompted you to get your MBA? To get more advice on how to be more entrepreneurial?**\\n\\nI was already writing my business plan and wasn't expecting it to be a full-time thing at that point in time. I think an MBA is a useful way to generate a more diverse network. It's very easy in the tech industry to build a great network of engineers and of other founders, and an MBA offers you more connections. \\n\\nIf I need an expert in retail who specifically worked with manufacturing in India, I can find somebody in my network who has that connection. An MBA gives you a big boost in terms of network and credibility. It gave me a lot of exposure to different businesses and a better ability now to pattern match things and look at a business idea and say “this is flawed for this reason.”\\n\\n---\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n\\n**As you said earlier, you wanted to do more than just one thing. This is something that a lot of undergrads think about: should they specialize and be amazing at one thing or should they be a jack of all trades? What is your perspective on that?**\\n\\nFor me, it's more of a personal thing. If I had to do one thing all day, programming would probably be the thing I'd most like to do. But, if I had to do one thing all the time, my enthusiasm would drop. Being an engineer all day is not something that I'd ultimately be successful at. I'm best when I'm doing a lot of different things and multitasking. \\n\\nFor other people, I think you can build a great career either way. There's a lot of room for specialists who are really great at machine learning or something like that. There's also a lot of room, specifically at smaller companies, for people who are good at juggling multiple things and you can really build a fantastic career too. The one thing I would encourage people against is needlessly specializing. There are some people who think \\\"I need a specialty\\\" and then they try to pick one, and that's great if they ultimately end up loving it but it's a very risky strategy because they might not and now they're stuck with it.\\n\\n>==Let the specialty come to you. If you're passionate about that something, go pursue that passion, but don't pick a specialty because you think you should pick one. That will ultimately hurt you.==\\n\\n**Students here get stressed about only having 4 years to figure that out. What’s your advice for those who still don’t know after graduation?**\\n\\nI think, for instance, if you're an engineer, you don't have to stay in any one place for a long period of time. I went to Google as a software engineer knowing that I wouldn't stay there forever, and that's totally fine. One of the values of going down the jack-of-all-trades route is that you can always specialize down the road if you wanted to. It's important for people to develop a good foundation in their career. One of the things Google did is it demonstrated proof that I understand how to code, whereas if I went to an unknown company, that would be much less true.\\n\\n**Knowing that you didn't want to be a software engineer your entire life, was being a writer something that had always been in the back of your mind?** \\n\\nNo, not at all. I write because that's a way of educating people, disseminating information, and making money but writing is not particularly a calling for me. \\n\\n<a href=\\\"#6\\\" style=\\\"font-size:18px;\\\"><span>*Back to \\\"Stories Worth Noting\\\"*</span></a>\\n\\n---\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n\\n**Your \\\"Cracking\\\" career series is so widely read now among students recruiting. What spurred the idea to write them?**\\n\\n![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-81e959238a39d9eb5d5c9a685e69d76d)\\n\\nI already ran [CareerCup](https://www.careercup.com/), which was a forum for interview questions, so I wrote a small interview guide to help people, and people really liked it. I realized I really like teaching, and one thing that was great at Penn was that I got to experience teaching [as a CIS TA]. So writing the book, to me, is a lot more about teaching than it is about writing. \\n\\n**What were the motivations behind CareerCup?**\\n\\nI started CareerCup after I graduated from Penn. It started with a word document of interview questions and I posted that online and it just grew from there. When I was a TA at Penn, I had a lot of students who were younger than me and looked to me for interview and career advice. So I created the doc to take the knowledge I had from interviewing and give it to them.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"#6\\\" style=\\\"font-size:18px;\\\"><span>*Back to \\\"Stories Worth Noting\\\"*</span></a>\\n\\n---\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n\\n**It's awesome to hear that you started this as early as at Penn. How can current students also build up that open knowledge-sharing culture?**\\n\\nIt starts with each person doing what they can to get that. I think most people are pretty happy to help out, so the best way is to offer ways for people to help and for younger people to reach out and ask for help. A lot of people don't know how to help. The Computer Science program has a pretty active Facebook group [CIS@Penn] for Penn people looking for advice, talking about the curriculum, etc. It's a great group for allowing people to get help and give back as well. Just understand that you don't make fun of people for asking dumb questions. Everybody has dumb questions and that's not a question of them being dumb.\\n\\n**I've realized that sometimes student mentors have this feeling that being only a year or two older than their mentee, they may not have the right advice to give. How do you overcome that?**\\n\\n>==What helped me is realizing that everybody feels like they don't know enough. Everybody has this imposter syndrome, that they don't feel like they know enough or that they got lucky.==\\n\\nJust realizing that this is pretty much universal. Given that, logically you’re feeling like you’re not good enough to give people advice has nothing to do with you actually not-being-good-enough. You're a junior mentoring a freshman. You learned a lot in those two years, and it's hard sometimes to quantify it. So it's easy for people to think that they haven't learned that much. But that advice, even though it's just one perspective, is still really useful for people. \\n\\n<a href=\\\"#6\\\" style=\\\"font-size:18px;\\\"><span>*Back to \\\"Stories Worth Noting\\\"*</span></a>\\n\\n---\\n<div id=\\\"4\\\"></div>\\n\\n**Do you have a favorite Penn moment or memory that has been very influential to your career path today?**\\n\\nOne of the most influential things was being a TA for what's now called CIS260 with Max Mintz. That was super useful. It not only gave me a foundation in a lot of computer science concepts that I needed, but it also gave me a ton of experience in public speaking and explaining new stuff to people. \\n\\nFrankly, I think public speaking should be required in colleges. Almost nobody gets enough experience with it. Teaching is one way - if you can teach a section, that's really good. I don’t know that a typical TA shift in which you're just answering questions one-on-one is as valuable. That doesn’t give you a lot of public speaking experience. But if you get to teach a section, it's an incredibly useful experience. Otherwise, speech and debate teams can be really useful, as well as taking a class that has a big public speaking component.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/XbkreMh.png\\n\\\" alt=\\\"Gayle McDowell's Penn Engineering Masters 2016 Commencement Address\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Gayle giving Penn Engineering Masters 2016 Commencement Address.</p>*\\n\\nThe thing with public speaking is that it's something that probably scares most people, but it's going to be so important later in your career. But by then, it's going to be hard for you to learn it when it's needed. When you're 40 and all of a sudden need to go speak at a bunch of conferences, you can't take time off to learn how to do that. And so learning it while you're in college is really important. *Editor's note: Penn offers several public speaking courses, workshops, and resources for students, [found here](https://www.college.upenn.edu/public-speaking).*\\n\\n**There are quite a few teaching opportunities for students now. For example, there are CIS half credits that are taught exclusively by students.**\\n\\nI actually started those classes! \\n\\n**Oh sweet! How did you start them?**\\n\\nI started a class that was just a software development class. This was before the half-credit classes existed. I started somewhat secretly and circumvented certain things around the administration. I did that for two years and then turned it over to another student to teach the following year after I graduated. Once we had several years of proof that students can teach classes and bad things will not happen, the administration actually put this as an official part of the program. *Editor's Note: CIS half-credits offered today include Python, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and mobile development. Check out [all of them here](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis19x/).*\\n\\n**Do you think the education of the future is students taking more of the initiative to teach other students, rather than relying on standardized education?**\\n\\nYeah, it's definitely important. \\n>==I realized that there will always be a disconnect between what professors teach and what you need to learn. Professors are researchers. They are not professional developers. And there is value in learning a bit about each, so people have to learn from some resources other than their professors.==\\n\\nI think the half-credit classes are awesome, but the other thing is students taking the initiative to learn themselves, and not expecting the curriculum to deliver the right education for them because it won't. Hackathons, like PennApps, is one great tool for getting kids to learn programing. One of the big weaknesses in the curriculum, which has largely been addressed now, has been a lack of practical experience, and that was what I wanted my independent class to do: give people practical programming experience. *Editor's note: [PennApps](http://pennapps.com/) is the original and largest college hackathon, held every semester at Penn. It features a competition, beginner workshops, and a career fair.*\\n\\n<a href=\\\"#6\\\" style=\\\"font-size:18px;\\\"><span>*Back to \\\"Stories Worth Noting\\\"*</span></a>\\n\\n---\\n<div id=\\\"5\\\"></div>\\n\\n**Computer science is now one of the most popular majors at Penn. But one issue is the steep learning curve seems to turn away non-major students who just want to try it out. What can we do to help make them more accessible?**\\n\\nFirst of all, one of the things that makes these classes inaccessible is that you have people who have a lot more knowledge of programming taking these classes. And then you also have a culture where people don't want to admit to struggling, and everybody acts like it's easy for them. We should focus more on recognition and making it more normal to admit that you're struggling, and for juniors and seniors who are doing okay to talk about how they struggled. \\n\\nSecond, there should be more opportunities in the early classes for catch-up. One of the things that I saw a lot of when I was a student was that in the freshmen classes, new people who got stuck in the first homework assignment or two but didn't want to fail cheated and copied somebody else's homework. And when the next assignment comes in, it's cumulative and they don't have the background do it and so they cheat again. By the time they realize how much education is lost, they don't have the ability to catch up anymore. So offering more ways for people to catch up with gaps in their own education is helpful.\\n\\n**Lastly, to take this beyond the classroom setting: What’s the best way for non-technical people to succeed in today’s tech landscape?**\\n\\nIt's nice for people who are in tech to have programmed before, but that doesn't mean you have to be a good programmer. ‘Having programmed before’ could be you doing the 10-hour workshop on Codecademy. You don't have to like programming, you don't have to be good at it, but learning a bit can be useful so you at least get over your fear of ‘I don't really know what programming is.’\\n\\nBeyond that, do things to show initiative. The tech industry as a whole really values that. If building an app is too intimidating for you, which it is for a lot of people, there are other ways of showing initiative without necessarily being technical. What I value are people who have started a club, created a blog, or ran a group that has raised money for some charity. That shows initiative.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"#6\\\" style=\\\"font-size:18px;\\\"><span>*Back to \\\"Stories Worth Noting\\\"*</span></a>\\n\\n---\\n\\n***From the Editor:***\\n*Gayle's Cracking the PM Interview has been instrumental in helping me and countless friends prep for the jobs and internships we have today. Coming from a non-technical background, I appreciated the clarity of concepts the book communicated. I noticed Gayle was active in several tech communities on Facebook, often giving career advice to stressed students, so I reached out about doing this interview. What began as a chat about her career path morphed into deeper discussions about building knowledge-sharing cultures at schools, overcoming Imposter Syndrome, and democratizing CIS education.

How can current students also build up that open knowledge-sharing culture?</strong></p>\n<p>It starts with each person doing what they can to get that. I think most people are pretty happy to help out, so the best way is to offer ways for people to help and for younger people to reach out and ask for help. A lot of people don't know how to help. The Computer Science program has a pretty active Facebook group [CIS@Penn] for Penn people looking for advice, talking about the curriculum, etc. It's a great group for allowing people to get help and give back as well. Just understand that you don't make fun of people for asking dumb questions. Everybody has dumb questions and that's not a question of them being dumb.</p>\n<p><strong>I've realized that sometimes student mentors have this feeling that being only a year or two older than their mentee, they may not have the right advice to give.

Everybody has this imposter syndrome, that they don't feel like they know enough or that they got lucky.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just realizing that this is pretty much universal. Given that, logically you’re feeling like you’re not good enough to give people advice has nothing to do with you actually not-being-good-enough. You're a junior mentoring a freshman. You learned a lot in those two years, and it's hard sometimes to quantify it. So it's easy for people to think that they haven't learned that much. But that advice, even though it's just one perspective, is still really useful for people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#6\" style=\"font-size:18px;\"><span><em>Back to &quot;Stories Worth Noting&quot;</em></span></a></p>\n<hr>\n<div id=\"4\"></div>\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite Penn moment or memory that has been very influential to your career path today?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most influential things was being a TA for what's now called CIS260 with Max Mintz. That was super useful. It not only gave me a foundation in a lot of computer science concepts that I needed, but it also gave me a ton of experience in public speaking and explaining new stuff to people.</p>\n<p>Frankly, I think public speaking should be required in colleges. Almost nobody gets enough experience with it. Teaching is one way - if you can teach a section, that's really good. I don’t know that a typical TA shift in which you're just answering questions one-on-one is as valuable. That doesn’t give you a lot of public speaking experience. But if you get to teach a section, it's an incredibly useful experience. Otherwise, speech and debate teams can be really useful, as well as taking a class that has a big public speaking component.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XbkreMh.png\n\" alt=\"Gayle McDowell's Penn Engineering Masters 2016 Commencement Address\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%\"><em><p align=\"center\">Gayle giving Penn Engineering Masters 2016 Commencement Address.</p></em></p>\n<p>The thing with public speaking is that it's something that probably scares most people, but it's going to be so important later in your career. But by then, it's going to be hard for you to learn it when it's needed. When you're 40 and all of a sudden need to go speak at a bunch of conferences, you can't take time off to learn how to do that. And so learning it while you're in college is really important. <em>Editor's note: Penn offers several public speaking courses, workshops, and resources for students, <a href=\"https://www.college.upenn.edu/public-speaking\">found here</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>There are quite a few teaching opportunities for students now.

Once we had several years of proof that students can teach classes and bad things will not happen, the administration actually put this as an official part of the program. <em>Editor's Note: CIS half-credits offered today include Python, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and mobile development.

Hackathons, like PennApps, is one great tool for getting kids to learn programing. One of the big weaknesses in the curriculum, which has largely been addressed now, has been a lack of practical experience, and that was what I wanted my independent class to do: give people practical programming experience. <em>Editor's note: <a href=\"http://pennapps.com/\">PennApps</a> is the original and largest college hackathon, held every semester at Penn.

How did you know you wanted to be a\nsoftware engineer?\n\nI knew since I started programming. My mother was an engineer who went to Penn\nEngineering as well, and she had forced me in high school to take one\nprogramming class before I graduated. I signed up and took it freshman year to\nget it out of the way, and ended up just really loving it. I loved building\nstuff and being able to create - it was just something that was very different.\nI feel like the rest of school was memorizing something, learning an equation,\nsolving and applying it, and programming was something very different. It was\nactually constructing a design something new and that really appealed to me.\n\nWhat prompted you to switch jobs?\n\nI worked at Google for three years. It was a great experience, but I ultimately\nleft because I didn't want to be a software developer full-time. I loved\nprogramming, but I liked being able to do more than one thing all day. So I left\nto join a start-up and then eventually started my own thing.\n\nIs that what prompted you to get your MBA? To get more advice on how to be more\nentrepreneurial?\n\nI was already writing my business plan and wasn't expecting it to be a full-time\nthing at that point in time. I think an MBA is a useful way to generate a more\ndiverse network. It's very easy in the tech industry to build a great network of\nengineers and of other founders, and an MBA offers you more connections.\n\nIf I need an expert in retail who specifically worked with manufacturing in\nIndia, I can find somebody in my network who has that connection. An MBA gives\nyou a big boost in terms of network and credibility. It gave me a lot of\nexposure to different businesses and a better ability now to pattern match\nthings and look at a business idea and say “this is flawed for this reason.”\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs you said earlier, you wanted to do more than just one thing. This is\nsomething that a lot of undergrads think about: should they specialize and be\namazing at one thing or should they be a jack of all trades? What is your\nperspective on that?\n\nFor me, it's more of a personal thing. If I had to do one thing all day,\nprogramming would probably be the thing I'd most like to do. But, if I had to do\none thing all the time, my enthusiasm would drop. Being an engineer all day is\nnot something that I'd ultimately be successful at. I'm best when I'm doing a\nlot of different things and multitasking.\n\nFor other people, I think you can build a great career either way. There's a lot\nof room for specialists who are really great at machine learning or something\nlike that. There's also a lot of room, specifically at smaller companies, for\npeople who are good at juggling multiple things and you can really build a\nfantastic career too. The one thing I would encourage people against is\nneedlessly specializing. There are some people who think \"I need a specialty\"\nand then they try to pick one, and that's great if they ultimately end up loving\nit but it's a very risky strategy because they might not and now they're stuck\nwith it.\n\nLet the specialty come to you. If you're passionate about that something, go\npursue that passion, but don't pick a specialty because you think you should\npick one. That will ultimately hurt you.\n\nStudents here get stressed about only having 4 years to figure that out. What’s\nyour advice for those who still don’t know after graduation?\n\nI think, for instance, if you're an engineer, you don't have to stay in any one\nplace for a long period of time. I went to Google as a software engineer knowing\nthat I wouldn't stay there forever, and that's totally fine. One of the values\nof going down the jack-of-all-trades route is that you can always specialize\ndown the road if you wanted to. It's important for people to develop a good\nfoundation in their career. One of the things Google did is it demonstrated\nproof that I understand how to code, whereas if I went to an unknown company,\nthat would be much less true.\n\nKnowing that you didn't want to be a software engineer your entire life, was\nbeing a writer something that had always been in the back of your mind?\n\nNo, not at all. I write because that's a way of educating people, disseminating\ninformation, and making money but writing is not particularly a calling for me.\n\nBack to \"Stories Worth Noting\"\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYour \"Cracking\" career series is so widely read now among students recruiting.\nWhat spurred the idea to write them?\n\n\n\nI already ran CareerCup [https://www.careercup.com/], which was a forum for\ninterview questions, so I wrote a small interview guide to help people, and\npeople really liked it. I realized I really like teaching, and one thing that\nwas great at Penn was that I got to experience teaching [as a CIS TA]. So\nwriting the book, to me, is a lot more about teaching than it is about writing.\n\nWhat were the motivations behind CareerCup?\n\nI started CareerCup after I graduated from Penn. It started with a word document\nof interview questions and I posted that online and it just grew from there.\nWhen I was a TA at Penn, I had a lot of students who were younger than me and\nlooked to me for interview and career advice. So I created the doc to take the\nknowledge I had from interviewing and give it to them.\n\nBack to \"Stories Worth Noting\"\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's awesome to hear that you started this as early as at Penn.

The premise of a lean startup is that you don't know anything about the market and plans always change. We came into entrepreneurship thinking that since things always change, you shouldn’t plan at all. We didn't have any long term plan or clear idea about where we want to go. We were just iterating on a day to day basis. It started fine, but eventually we realized it's not the best way to be a start-up. You just end up following the whims of the customers that day. \\n\\nAfter realizing this, we started implementing processes and thinking. After three years and seeing all the other startups in the internet space, we started to have intuition of where the world is going in terms of internet, SaaS, and software, and how that affects the recruitment market.

First, Professor **[Angela Duckworth](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/angela-duckworth)** and Professor [Martin Seligman](https://penncoursereview.com/instructor/1033-MARTIN-E--P--SELIGMAN), both of whom focus on positive psychology ([PSYC 266](http://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/sites/ppc.sas.upenn.edu/files/duckworth2014positivepsychology.pdf)). \\n\\nSecond, Professor **[Adam Grant](https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/grantad/)**: I've had dinner with him before, I’ve sat in lecture, and I wish I had taken his class. I completely understand why he’s the highest rated Professor at Wharton. (*Editor's note: Grant teachers [Organizational Behavior](https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT238) under the Management department.*) \\n\\n<img src= \\\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/55455_duckworthf.jpg \\\" style=\\\"width:80%;height:80%;\\\"vertical-align:middle\\\"> *<p align=\\\"center\\\"> Angela Duckworth and Adam Grant. \\nSource: Helen Fetaw / The Daily Pennsylvanian.</p>*\\n\\nIn English, Professor **[Paul K. Saint-Amour](https://www.english.upenn.edu/people/paul-k-saint-amour)** was my favorite. He taught me how powerful it is to be able to speak and write beautifully. That man can speak and synthesize abstraction like no one I've ever met. Everything comes down to storytelling. You think about why cave paintings matter, how people reiterate the success and failures of wars — all of that is storytelling. He showed me the most prime version of that. \\n\\nThen, I’d say Professor **[Peter Decherney](https://cinemastudies.sas.upenn.edu/people/PeterDecherney)** is amazing. He teaches in the Cinema Studies Department. I think he's one of the foremost thinkers on fair use law which in the entertainment industry is the biggest issue right now. You have someone who's literally shaping billions of dollars worth of lawsuits and is in the Cinema Studies department. \\n\\nAnother one is Professor Charles Dwyer. He taught a course called “Managing People.” It’s a graduate studies class in the Annenberg School for Communication. He was the head of the Executive Education Program in Wharton. So even if he's not teaching I would look at someone else who does. He will teach you [how to manipulate people](https://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/thought-leadership/wharton-at-work/2012/12/increase-your-influence) like no one else will. \\n\\nMore importantly, he teaches you how you think about your own purpose in life and how to manifest it. That class changed my life. If I would isolate a single class that I found most valuable, it would be that, and no one knows about it because it’s a graduate level class.(*Editor's note: This class doesn't seem to exist anymore. But there are many other graduate-level classes that are available to undergrads.*)\\n\\n**What was your favorite extracurricular activity?** \\n\\nThe [Ivy Council](www.ivycouncil.org) was by far my favorite thing, and the reason why is because we were basically building an international enterprise. I forged official partnerships with the Chinese government union, and we created an exchange program where the student government leaders of the Ivy League meet with the student government leaders in China. In China, student leaders are direct feeders into the actual government. So really, the people we met with are going to be running the country some day. We know the vice chairman of the biggest media company there. \\n\\nThis program exists today, so it's a decade-long program. We were doing real work that has real impact, like professional entities instead of working on a small college level. It was global. That by far was my favorite. I'm convinced that experience is what got me my job [at Google].\\n\\n**Could you touch on your internship experiences?**\\n\\nI learned a lot of skills during a summer that I worked doing the creative development of feature films for Disney. It was amazing because I got to learn and observe how the industry works. My last project was Frozen — at the time it was called The Snow Queen — and that really taught me an appreciation for how cool and careful traditional filmmaking was. In fact, it’s the exact opposite of how tech works and then I realized that's exactly what I do *not* want to do when I graduate. I realized in that system, I would be a servant for six years and then maybe at most be a manager. In tech, I could go build something from scratch tomorrow. \\n\\nI care about creativity more than ever now. But I don't want to go to the traditional system when I graduate. That was basically the lesson. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"5\\\"></div>\\n**One of my friends also wants to do creative writing, except her parents want her to do pre-med or pre-law. When you decided to study English, did you face any backlash?** \\n\\nMy parents are typical immigrant Americans. They both literally came from nothing. My father became CFO of Philips; my mother became CFO of the biggest sign-making company in the world. They’re very conservative because they came from nothing. When you're a person of color and in my mother’s case, a woman of color, you have to try twice as hard to get half as much. Of course, they did not approve of me wanting to become Walt Disney, go into entertainment, and major in English. What I did was this: I didn't listen to them. \\n\\nThey thought I was in political science until I got my Google job. \\n>==Don’t bend to them [your parents] because then you compromise your own dream. Have them bend to you. You have to realize it’s your life.== \\n \\nAnd at the end of the day, when they say they want you to go to law school or med school, what they mean is they want you to be safe, successful, and happy.  They just don't know how that manifests for you. Once you find that success — and you will find it if you persist — they will understand that happiness and success means something different for you. \\n\\nI wanted to do something different, and when you do something that's different there’s a fear that comes with that. It’s the fear that, if you fail, there will be no one to catch you. So I had to get over that too. Honestly, the best thing I can tell you is to look at why you’re fundamentally doing something. If you're willing to die for it, then it's the right thing to do. \\n\\n>==Secondly, remember that everyone who came before you were no more talented or smarter than you are. The only distinction between them and you is that they actually went for it and they did it. Persistence is the only thing that separates those of us who are great from those who just lived.== \\n\\n<img src= \\\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/eb/f6/dcebf6a3d322d6aa27972e3b454fd81b--career-inspiration-motivation-inspiration.jpg \\\" style=\\\"width:80%;height:80%;\\\"vertical-align:middle\\\"> *<p align=\\\"center\\\"> Source: Pinterest.</p>*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Header photo courtesy of Bing Chen's [Instagram](www.instagram.com/BingChen).*\\n\\n[![](/content/images/2017/02/mail-icon-wide-white-7.png)](mailto:writers+bing_chen2@thesign.al)\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://thesign.al/bing-chen-on-the-penn-experience/\">Back to Part 1</a></strong></p>\n<p>Bing Chen is a creator and entrepreneur who currently runs his own content studio company: Bing Studios.

He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania\nin 2009, majoring in English and minoring in psychology and marketing. (Full\nintroduction in Part 1.)\n\nStories worth noting:\n1)  \n His absolute favorite professors at Penn.Read\n 2)  \n How he hid being an English major from his parents and how to face pressure\nfrom parents.Read</tr>\n\n\n**Did you have any favorite professors at Penn?**Yes, I have several. First,\nProfessor Angela Duckworth\n[https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/angela-duckworth]  and Professor \nMartin\nSeligman [https://penncoursereview.com/instructor/1033-MARTIN-E--P--SELIGMAN],\nboth of whom focus on positive psychology (PSYC 266\n[http://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/sites/ppc.sas.upenn.edu/files/duckworth2014positivepsychology.pdf]\n).\n\nSecond, Professor Adam Grant [https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/grantad/]:\nI've had dinner with him before, I’ve sat in lecture, and I wish I had taken his\nclass. I completely understand why he’s the highest rated Professor at Wharton.\n(Editor's note: Grant teachers Organizational Behavior\n[https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/?course=MGMT238]  under the Management\ndepartment.)\n\n<img src= \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/55455_duckworthf.jpg  \"\nstyle=\"width:80%;height:80%;\"vertical-align:middle\">   Angela Duckworth and Adam\nGrant.\nSource: Helen Fetaw / The Daily Pennsylvanian.\n\n\n\nIn English, Professor Paul K. Saint-Amour\n[https://www.english.upenn.edu/people/paul-k-saint-amour]  was my favorite. He\ntaught me how powerful it is to be able to speak and write beautifully. That man\ncan speak and synthesize abstraction like no one I've ever met. Everything comes\ndown to storytelling. You think about why cave paintings matter, how people\nreiterate the success and failures of wars — all of that is storytelling. He\nshowed me the most prime version of that.\n\nThen, I’d say Professor Peter Decherney\n[https://cinemastudies.sas.upenn.edu/people/PeterDecherney]  is amazing. He\nteaches in the Cinema Studies Department. I think he's one of the foremost\nthinkers on fair use law which in the entertainment industry is the biggest\nissue right now. You have someone who's literally shaping billions of dollars\nworth of lawsuits and is in the Cinema Studies department.\n\nAnother one is Professor Charles Dwyer. He taught a course called “Managing\nPeople.” It’s a graduate studies class in the Annenberg School for\nCommunication. He was the head of the Executive Education Program in Wharton. So\neven if he's not teaching I would look at someone else who does. He will teach\nyou how to manipulate people\n[https://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/thought-leadership/wharton-at-work/2012/12/increase-your-influence] \n like no one else will.\n\nMore importantly, he teaches you how you think about your own purpose in life\nand how to manifest it. That class changed my life. If I would isolate a single\nclass that I found most valuable, it would be that, and no one knows about it\nbecause it’s a graduate level class.(Editor's note: This class doesn't seem to\nexist anymore.

I always thought I wanted to be a writer even in high school, but I didn't really have any particular concept of what that looks like. I went to a high school outside of Philadelphia and we had a program where you could miss the last semester of your senior year if you got an approved internship. So I was actually working at a news radio station for that semester, and at that point I thought I probably wanted to be a journalist.\\n\\nI started out college as an international relations and economics major, but as I went through I realized I just like reading and writing papers so I changed to English. And I think even though Penn had no film program at all, they had one professor, a guy named Mark Crispin Miller who's actually at NYU now. He did a Hitchcock film and a Kubrick film course and they were basically the only film courses that I can remember but a buddy of mine dragged me to one of them and they were fantastic. So I took everything that he taught and that was sort of how I got into film. I didn't have any idea you could actually write for movies. Growing up I just didn't even think that people did that. \\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Mark_Crispin_Miller.png/1024px-Mark_Crispin_Miller.png\\\" alt=\\\"Mark Crispin Miller\\\" style=\\\"width:50%;height:50%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Mark Crispin Miller, pictured above, is a professor currently at NYU who inspired Scott's interest in film.</p>*\\n\\nAt the same time I took a course by this professor Cary Mazer in English Dramatic Writing that was really great. And so I got into playwriting simultaneously. So by the time I was a senior I had done a semester abroad in Paris and when I came back from that I was really ready to go to New York and just get on with things and start writing. So I set up my schedule such that I could go to Penn a couple of days a week, I was working at a restaurant downtown, and then I'd take the last train to New York and be there for like two days a week. I did that for my senior year, basically going back and forth. \\n\\n**Wow! Did you have a gig at New York or something like that?**\\n\\nNot really, I actually just did a lot of odd jobs. I kind of became an accidental actor. I don't really remember exactly how it worked but I somehow ended up acting in a shoe commercial. Again I didn't even really realize people act, like it wasn't a realistic thing. I made a few thousand dollars in residuals over the summer which for college kids was amazing. \\n\\nSo I ended up getting a bit of an acting career that was my day job weirdly enough—and that brought me to LA because that's where the money in acting was. I kept coming out to LA for paid work and at some point I just stayed. But I was always writing and always wanted to write. \\n\\nThe thing that kind of got me back to it full time was the writers' strike because all work stopped. I did this playwrights’ workshop that was a multi-week workshop and conference. There were a lot of really interesting writers in it and that kind of got me back on the serious writing track. I also met my wife there so that was a big moment. And from there I really focused back on the writing, though I kept acting on the side for quite a while after that to pay the bills. \\n\\n>==Acting was actually the greatest thing for writing for me in multiple ways. Getting to sit behind the camera—since I usually didn't have very big parts so I sat around a lot waiting to do something—I got to watch people work, watch people interact. I got to watch really good directors direct.==\\n\\nSo I wrote tons and tons because there's just a lot of sitting around waiting.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"http://d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/onix/cvr9781481489577/rolie-polie-olie-9781481489577_hr.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Rolie Polie Olie\\\" style=\\\"width:50%;height:50%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Scott was a writer for Rolie Polie Olie along with his wife.</p>*\\n\\nEventually my wife and I had our first kid and we were making a low budget movie that we were basically producing. Our kid was 8 months old when she was offered an animated show called Rolie Polie Olie. And she thought she'd try it out. Not only did it work out as a practical matter, but she really really dug it. And then they doubled the order so she needed help so she begged me to help her. It turned out I really liked it and that's kind of how we stumbled into the kids and animation space and that's basically the space we stayed in for the last 20 years. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n**That really takes us back to memories watching <em>Rolie Polie Olie</em> as a kid.**\\n\\nIt's funny because one of our one of our favorite moments was when our first kid was at preschool and they were asking everybody what their parents do. And our daughter said, _my parents tell Olie what to say_. I thought that's a pretty okay job description. It was pretty fun writing for our kids and their friends. And I think if we didn't have kids we would not have been very good at it. Having an audience right at home and spending time with them, you really knew what was going to keep them interested and entertained.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n**And <em>Rolie Polie Olie</em> was your first Emmy right? Did you feel that was when you really \\\"made it\\\" in the industry?**\\n\\nI think that concept is really an unhelpful concept in general. Obviously there are super successful people that kind of have it set. But it's a very entrepreneurial industry and you really have to go out prove yourself again the next time and the next time and the next time. Yes, you get to levels where you're probably going to be able to feed yourself, and that's really important especially once you have kids. But I think it's a really unhelpful concept that one job or show or something means you've made it. And I watch a lot of aspiring writers looking for that. Really what you should be doing and are doing is building a reputation that's more transcendent than that. There are plenty of writers who get really high on the mountain or whatever you want to call it and fall off and have to start all over. \\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQzOTQ0MDMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAwNzA3OQ@@._V1_SY1000_CR0,0,1114,1000_AL_.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Scott Kraft Grammy\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Scott Kraft winning the Emmy for Outstanding Special Class Animation in his role on Rolie Polie Olie.</p>*\\n\\n**It seems you took a leap of faith in knowing that you loved writing and wanted to pursue it – how did you have the confidence to do that?**\\n\\nYou know, I really have no idea. If I did anything that was sort of smart—even though I didn't know I was doing it—was that I was just really open to opportunity. If somebody said, *hey you want to come down here and PA on this job, standing and blocking traffic on 3rd Street?* I would just go yeah, and I would show up. And it was partly out of necessity, but it was also because I didn't have any clear picture of what I wanted to do. \\n\\nI know a lot of the Penn people out here who have done really well and they had much more clear pictures of what they wanted to do and I didn't really. I also had this idea that I was just going to go experience a lot of stuff. And I did. I just went and I did a lot of different jobs. I drove a flower delivery truck in Manhattan. I was a waiter and a bartender and I just sort of assumed that was part of the writer's education so I didn't have any issues with it \\n\\n**Was there any opportunity that in the moment didn't seem that significant for you but ended up being sort of a blessing in disguise?**\\n\\nI think that attending the playwrights' workshop and conference was that for me. Just in that I met a lot of the people I ended up working with in theatre companies at that moment. I met my wife which was huge. It was sort of that moment when I was 27-28 years old and I really threw down and decided if I'm going to be a writer I need to stop the odd-jobbing and start putting pages out. It took me until then to learn that you actually have to write things to be a writer. I realized you have to write fifteen screenplays that never get produced, that no one cares about, that everyone thinks stinks, before you write something that's marginally decent. You have to write fifteen plays, put eight of them up and watch six people watch them and be unconcerned until you find something that works. It is really a very grindy career; it is not the picture of writing that a lot of people have.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n**What's your advice for Penn students interested in going down this path of writing?**\\n\\nThere are way more resources now and there's way more of a community than when I was at Penn. I actually support the Kelly Writers House because they are so fantastic for that. You should just go hang out at that place all the time. \\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/53591_kwhf.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Kelly Writers House\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">The Kelly Writers House is located just past the bridge over 38th St.</p>*\\n\\nBut the opportunity to really meet and hang out with writers is important. And you have to learn the business if you want to make money at it. It's an entrepreneurial business that requires time and effort and energy and networking and involves endless rejection at every level. There are huge names that have been trying to get movies or pet projects done for their entire careers and it never happened because you've got to convince someone to give you 60, 100, 200, 400 million dollars to go do something, and that's as entrepreneurial as any startup. \\n\\nIt never occurred to me at the time that that there was a need to understand the money-raising side of things. I started as an econ major so I actually understand that stuff very well and I can read a budget, but it took me a long time to realize that that's actually a really good skill. I think Penn has an amazing set of resources now that we didn't have when I was there. \\n\\n>==But at the end of the day writing's writing and writing is sitting down and putting words on the page. And the second part—which is in some ways the harder part—is sending it to somebody and then another somebody and then another somebody until they decide they want to do something with it.==\\n\\nWhen I was getting my MFA, one of my instructors said he had never written something that didn't get published. And he said the only reason is because he would not stop sending it out until got published! He just would not let anything sit unread on his desk; he made sure it got out there. With every film script, every play, every article that's not commissioned, it doesn't matter who you are until somebody says yes to making it or publishing it—until then it's just like everybody else's.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Scott Kraft is a television writer and executive producer who graduated from Penn in 1983 as an English major.

I did that for my senior year, basically going back and forth.</p>\n<p><strong>Wow! Did you have a gig at New York or something like that?</strong></p>\n<p>Not really, I actually just did a lot of odd jobs. I kind of became an accidental actor. I don't really remember exactly how it worked but I somehow ended up acting in a shoe commercial. Again I didn't even really realize people act, like it wasn't a realistic thing. I made a few thousand dollars in residuals over the summer which for college kids was amazing.</p>\n<p>So I ended up getting a bit of an acting career that was my day job weirdly enough—and that brought me to LA because that's where the money in acting was. I kept coming out to LA for paid work and at some point I just stayed. But I was always writing and always wanted to write.</p>\n<p>The thing that kind of got me back to it full time was the writers' strike because all work stopped. I did this playwrights’ workshop that was a multi-week workshop and conference. There were a lot of really interesting writers in it and that kind of got me back on the serious writing track. I also met my wife there so that was a big moment. And from there I really focused back on the writing, though I kept acting on the side for quite a while after that to pay the bills.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>Acting was actually the greatest thing for writing for me in multiple ways. Getting to sit behind the camera—since I usually didn't have very big parts so I sat around a lot waiting to do something—I got to watch people work, watch people interact. I got to watch really good directors direct.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I wrote tons and tons because there's just a lot of sitting around waiting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/onix/cvr9781481489577/rolie-polie-olie-9781481489577_hr.jpg\" alt=\"Rolie Polie Olie\" style=\"width:50%;height:50%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Scott was a writer for Rolie Polie Olie along with his wife.</p></em></p>\n<p>Eventually my wife and I had our first kid and we were making a low budget movie that we were basically producing.

And then they doubled the order so she needed help so she begged me to help her. It turned out I really liked it and that's kind of how we stumbled into the kids and animation space and that's basically the space we stayed in for the last 20 years.</p>\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\n**That really takes us back to memories watching <em>Rolie Polie Olie</em> as a kid.**\n<p>It's funny because one of our one of our favorite moments was when our first kid was at preschool and they were asking everybody what their parents do. And our daughter said, <em>my parents tell Olie what to say</em>. I thought that's a pretty okay job description. It was pretty fun writing for our kids and their friends. And I think if we didn't have kids we would not have been very good at it. Having an audience right at home and spending time with them, you really knew what was going to keep them interested and entertained.</p>\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n**And <em>Rolie Polie Olie</em> was your first Emmy right? Did you feel that was when you really \"made it\" in the industry?**\n<p>I think that concept is really an unhelpful concept in general.

But it's a very entrepreneurial industry and you really have to go out prove yourself again the next time and the next time and the next time. Yes, you get to levels where you're probably going to be able to feed yourself, and that's really important especially once you have kids. But I think it's a really unhelpful concept that one job or show or something means you've made it. And I watch a lot of aspiring writers looking for that. Really what you should be doing and are doing is building a reputation that's more transcendent than that.

I realized you have to write fifteen screenplays that never get produced, that no one cares about, that everyone thinks stinks, before you write something that's marginally decent.

After graduation, he spent a few years in New\nYork as an actor before moving to LA. He later became a writer and was nominated\nfor multiple Emmy awards, winning two Daytime Emmys–one of which was for his\nwriting role in Rolie Polie Olie. He has been an Executive Producer at\nNickelodeon since 2012. He tells us his story and insights into a career of\nwriting below:\n\nStories worth noting:\n1)  \n How being a parent helped him be a better writer for children's television\n Read\n 2)  \n How the concept of \"making it\" in the industry is counterproductive\n Read\n 3)\n Pursuing a successful writing career is \"as entrepreneurial as any startup\" \nReadWe’d love to hear your recount of getting from Penn to now, including key\ndecision points and what inspired you.\n\nI'd like to say there were key decision points but it was a little less\nconscious than that. I always thought I wanted to be a writer even in high\nschool, but I didn't really have any particular concept of what that looks like.\nI went to a high school outside of Philadelphia and we had a program where you\ncould miss the last semester of your senior year if you got an approved\ninternship. So I was actually working at a news radio station for that semester,\nand at that point I thought I probably wanted to be a journalist.\n\nI started out college as an international relations and economics major, but as\nI went through I realized I just like reading and writing papers so I changed to\nEnglish. And I think even though Penn had no film program at all, they had one\nprofessor, a guy named Mark Crispin Miller who's actually at NYU now. He did a\nHitchcock film and a Kubrick film course and they were basically the only film\ncourses that I can remember but a buddy of mine dragged me to one of them and\nthey were fantastic. So I took everything that he taught and that was sort of\nhow I got into film. I didn't have any idea you could actually write for movies.\nGrowing up I just didn't even think that people did that.\n\nMark Crispin Miller, pictured above, is a professor currently at NYU who\ninspired Scott's interest in film.\n\n\n\nAt the same time I took a course by this professor Cary Mazer in English\nDramatic Writing that was really great. And so I got into playwriting\nsimultaneously.

As undergraduate students, it's your first time away from home, so finding a group of like minded folk that you could bond with and share experiences with was super important to my experience early on. To this day, some of my best friends are my FIJI brothers I met when I went to school. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\nOutside of class, I was decently entrepreneurial. I worked on a couple different companies while I was at Penn – I started a resume company, and worked on another software company that was started by some ex-Wharton professors. So I exercised my entrepreneurial genes while at Penn, which was always fun and different. Doing that at school went hand in hand with my summers spent in Silicon Valley working in startup companies.\\n\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.phigam.org/image/chapter-page-photos/Penn-Chapter-House.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sal Videos\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">FIJI's house,\\n Schlein's fraternity.</p>*\\n \\n**What was the motivation behind your resume company and what was it like starting something on your own in college?**\\n\\nWell, I had a Macintosh and a laser printer at the time and most people didn’t have those in their rooms, so everyone kept using my computer to do resumes! So then I figured I could start to make some money off of this laser printer, and I could print resumes for people. \\n\\nThe experience was pretty rewarding since it forced me to think of a way to market and come up with a unique value proposition (in my case it was the ability to make unlimited changes). You learn how important unique value propositions are if you're going to start a business. So it was a pretty successful way to leverage assets that I already had. And then I hired: somebody to help with marketing, somebody to do data input. So I got a little bit of experience hiring people and getting them to do things. It was a fun foray into the world of entrepreneurship in a small way.\\n\\n\\n<img src=\\\"http://penntechtrek.com/img/group_photos/7.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sal Videos\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Students on Penn's Fall Tech Trek, an event that Schlein participated in.</p>*\\n \\n**You mentioned that you interned at different startups in Silicon Valley. Can you talk about your experience there and how it might have influenced where you are today?**\\n \\nWell, you have to remember back then in the 80s there weren’t many tech companies yet. So I was kind of lucky, my family lived in California and my sister was one of the first evangelists in the Macintosh group. She knew everyone who was developing software for the Macintosh and so I was able to leverage that to get different jobs over the summer. My first role was at a personal robot company where I was doing software design as well as market research. Another summer, I worked for the very first Macintosh independent software vendors called T/Makers, and at a summer job you basically do anything they asked you to do. It's cool because there’s not that many people so you have the opportunity to do a lot and learn a lot and you kind of fall in love with it. \\n\\nI particularly loved the vagaries of a startup. There's not a lot of structure. You don't know what's going to happen the next day and you love that. If you want to come here, it's not like going to a big company where you know it's very structured and you know if I do *this* then *that* will happen; it's not that way and that's not for everybody. But I did that during my summers. \\n \\n**What was it like joining Symantec as a startup right after college?**\\n \\nI didn't think twice about it. Back then, I think they were like three software startups out here. Once again it was different; a different world in a different time in the evolution of Silicon Valley and innovation. I've had the privilege of being around it for over 30 years now and it is as cool as ever. Maybe the entrepreneurs are different, maybe the ideas are different but entrepreneurship is pretty much the same. And I would argue for the most part while the market dynamics change, how you do venture capital I don't think has changed all that much.\\n\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Symantec_Headquarters_Mountain_View.jpg/1200px-Symantec_Headquarters_Mountain_View.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sal Videos\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Symantec, a company Schlein previously headed as Vice President.</p>*\\n\\n \\n**Could you talk about what led you to join KPCB and what the motivations were around that switch?**\\n \\nSo Symantec was funded by Kleiner Perkins, and on the board of Symantec were two Kleiner Perkins partners, John Doerr and Jim Lally. So as a result, given what I did for Symantec, I presented to the board quite a bit and I got to know a lot of these folks. Back in ‘96, KPCB was starting a new fund called the Java fund, right when the programming language Java was coming out. Kleiner Perkins had just backed Sun Microsystems and they wanted somebody to help to promote Java and Java adoption. So the idea at Kleiner Perkins was that we'll start this thing called the Java fund and use that to promote people using Java, and they came to me and asked me to run that. I jumped into it and that was 20 years ago.\\n \\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n**So at KPCB, perhaps similar to your work at Symantec, you've led a lot of investments into cyber security and related startups in the space. What particularly draws you to Internet security?**\\n \\nWell, my big claim to fame at Symantec was that I designed and brought to the market the first commercial antivirus software in the world. I did have a passion for the field, but I would argue you get lucky in a lot of things in life and in business. I'm not going to sit here and tell you I knew this would work out the way it worked out, but it did. I started to get an appreciation for how one of the base instincts of humanity is to be safe. The first antivirus software I think was actually on the Macintosh, believe it or not.

And I think actually picking is really important. I think you got to pick what you want to really be good at.\\n\\n\\n<img src=\\\"http://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kleinerperkins__130326172340.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sal Videos\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">KPCB, Schlein's current company.</p>*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n**For students interested in entering the venture space, what are some of the things that people don't really realize in terms of what venture is actually about?**\\n \\nI get asked the question by students all the time. Not speaking for late or growth oriented venture, but particularly with early stage venture, it’s a really hard thing to decide you want to go into. It's hard to take early venture as a career path and say I'm going to do this. If you want to do early stage venture, you're identifying an entrepreneur and an idea before anyone else has ever thought of it and you want to try and go build a brand new business before anyone else. So you got to go out and experience it yourself, whether being an entrepreneur or working in an entrepreneurial company. Then you need to exhibit some level of success in doing it. Think about it: you want to earn the right to provide funding to some great entrepreneur’s life story and life's work and you've got to give them advice and figure out how to help them. Almost nothing in venture is about the money. It's all about “can I help them build their company and how am I going to help them build their company?” I think it's very hard to do that if you A) have not done it yourself or B) don't have the experiences to truly be able to help the entrepreneur get a competitive advantage. That's generally the high-level advice I give.\\n\\nThen there are skills I think everyone should get. Communication skills. Whenever you have the opportunity to present in front of a group, do it. I don't care if you're an engineer, I don't care who you are. Learn how to communicate. And it goes hand in hand with selling skills. You want to be a venture capitalist or an entrepreneur? You're going to have to learn how to sell. So I always tell people if you have the opportunity in your careers early on, get yourself a quota, figure out how to get somebody to part with money. It'll make you better at whatever job you take, whether you're an engineer or in marketing or whatever. And most venture capitalists come from the product side of life. I was a product manager. Being a product person is what it's all about. You’ve got to understand product. You've got to understand why customers want a product and what's going to make a customer want a product. I highly stress getting into product management if you can, that's a good grooming ground eventually for being a venture capitalist.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"4\\\"></div>\\n**To wrap things up, what advice would you give for smart, driven Penn students?**\\n \\nFirst of all, patience. Chances are that the very first job you get, you may not be doing everything you think you deserve to be doing and want to be doing. But eventually you’ll get there. So give it some time. \\n\\nSecond thing, a Penn student today is outrageously smart, and I don't want them to feel entitled. You got it into Penn and that's wonderful. Maybe you're paying for it, maybe your parents are paying for it, or maybe you got a scholarship. All great. But remember—no one owes you anything. You have to go out and earn it, whatever it's going to be, you earn it. So don't approach all this with some sense of entitlement. \\n\\nNext, very early in your careers—it's important where you are on the integrity scale. I have a saying that I use all the time: integrity is binary, it's either a zero or a one. There's no grey in integrity. There's no “today I'm going to have integrity on this issue but tomorrow I'm not.” It doesn't work that way. So decide where you are and live by it, even if it's not popular. You'll have a much better experience in life. \\n\\nFinally, do what you say you're going to do. If you commit to doing something, do it. Do not be one of those people in the group where they go \\\"Ted says he's going to do it but we know he's not, he never follows through.\\\" You do not want to go through life that way. If you can't get it done then just say you can't get it done. But don't be one of those people that doesn't live up to doing what they say they're going to do. Don't commit to it if you can't do it.

As undergraduate students, it's your first time away from home, so finding a group of like minded folk that you could bond with and share experiences with was super important to my experience early on. To this day, some of my best friends are my FIJI brothers I met when I went to school.</p>\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\nOutside of class, I was decently entrepreneurial. I worked on a couple different companies while I was at Penn – I started a resume company, and worked on another software company that was started by some ex-Wharton professors. So I exercised my entrepreneurial genes while at Penn, which was always fun and different. Doing that at school went hand in hand with my summers spent in Silicon Valley working in startup companies.\n<p><img src=\"https://www.phigam.org/image/chapter-page-photos/Penn-Chapter-House.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Videos\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">FIJI's house,<br>\nSchlein's fraternity.</p></em></p>\n<p><strong>What was the motivation behind your resume company and what was it like starting something on your own in college?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I had a Macintosh and a laser printer at the time and most people didn’t have those in their rooms, so everyone kept using my computer to do resumes! So then I figured I could start to make some money off of this laser printer, and I could print resumes for people.</p>\n<p>The experience was pretty rewarding since it forced me to think of a way to market and come up with a unique value proposition (in my case it was the ability to make unlimited changes). You learn how important unique value propositions are if you're going to start a business. So it was a pretty successful way to leverage assets that I already had. And then I hired: somebody to help with marketing, somebody to do data input. So I got a little bit of experience hiring people and getting them to do things. It was a fun foray into the world of entrepreneurship in a small way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://penntechtrek.com/img/group_photos/7.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Videos\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Students on Penn's Fall Tech Trek, an event that Schlein participated in.</p></em></p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned that you interned at different startups in Silicon Valley. Can you talk about your experience there and how it might have influenced where you are today?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, you have to remember back then in the 80s there weren’t many tech companies yet. So I was kind of lucky, my family lived in California and my sister was one of the first evangelists in the Macintosh group. She knew everyone who was developing software for the Macintosh and so I was able to leverage that to get different jobs over the summer. My first role was at a personal robot company where I was doing software design as well as market research. Another summer, I worked for the very first Macintosh independent software vendors called T/Makers, and at a summer job you basically do anything they asked you to do. It's cool because there’s not that many people so you have the opportunity to do a lot and learn a lot and you kind of fall in love with it.</p>\n<p>I particularly loved the vagaries of a startup. There's not a lot of structure. You don't know what's going to happen the next day and you love that. If you want to come here, it's not like going to a big company where you know it's very structured and you know if I do <em>this</em> then <em>that</em> will happen; it's not that way and that's not for everybody. But I did that during my summers.</p>\n<p><strong>What was it like joining Symantec as a startup right after college?</strong></p>\n<p>I didn't think twice about it. Back then, I think they were like three software startups out here. Once again it was different; a different world in a different time in the evolution of Silicon Valley and innovation. I've had the privilege of being around it for over 30 years now and it is as cool as ever. Maybe the entrepreneurs are different, maybe the ideas are different but entrepreneurship is pretty much the same. And I would argue for the most part while the market dynamics change, how you do venture capital I don't think has changed all that much.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Symantec_Headquarters_Mountain_View.jpg/1200px-Symantec_Headquarters_Mountain_View.jpg\" alt=\"Sal Videos\" style=\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\"><em><p align=\"center\">Symantec, a company Schlein previously headed as Vice President.</p></em></p>\n<p><strong>Could you talk about what led you to join KPCB and what the motivations were around that switch?</strong></p>\n<p>So Symantec was funded by Kleiner Perkins, and on the board of Symantec were two Kleiner Perkins partners, John Doerr and Jim Lally. So as a result, given what I did for Symantec, I presented to the board quite a bit and I got to know a lot of these folks. Back in ‘96, KPCB was starting a new fund called the Java fund, right when the programming language Java was coming out. Kleiner Perkins had just backed Sun Microsystems and they wanted somebody to help to promote Java and Java adoption. So the idea at Kleiner Perkins was that we'll start this thing called the Java fund and use that to promote people using Java, and they came to me and asked me to run that. I jumped into it and that was 20 years ago.</p>\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\n**So at KPCB, perhaps similar to your work at Symantec, you've led a lot of investments into cyber security and related startups in the space. What particularly draws you to Internet security?**\n<p>Well, my big claim to fame at Symantec was that I designed and brought to the market the first commercial antivirus software in the world. I did have a passion for the field, but I would argue you get lucky in a lot of things in life and in business. I'm not going to sit here and tell you I knew this would work out the way it worked out, but it did. I started to get an appreciation for how one of the base instincts of humanity is to be safe. The first antivirus software I think was actually on the Macintosh, believe it or not. It started because Mac users loved their computers versus PC users, who really thought of their computers as more of a utility than anything else. They didn't care that much about them. I started on the Mac and it just worked out pretty fantastically well.

I have a saying that I use all the time: integrity is binary, it's either\na zero or a one. There's no grey in integrity. There's no “today I'm going to\nhave integrity on this issue but tomorrow I'm not.” It doesn't work that way. So\ndecide where you are and live by it, even if it's not popular. You'll have a\nmuch better experience in life.\n\nFinally, do what you say you're going to do. If you commit to doing something,\ndo it. Do not be one of those people in the group where they go \"Ted says he's\ngoing to do it but we know he's not, he never follows through.\" You do not want\nto go through life that way. If you can't get it done then just say you can't\nget it done. But don't be one of those people that doesn't live up to doing what\nthey say they're going to do. Don't commit to it if you can't do it. There's a\nfew words of wisdom.","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/02/TSchleinLowRes.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5ba832115ee55800011ab86d","created_at":"2018-02-22 18:50:27","created_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab863","updated_at":"2018-03-11 02:25:20","updated_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85f","published_at":"2018-03-02 21:43:38","published_by":"5ba832115ee55800011ab85f"},{"id":"5ba832145ee55800011ab930","uuid":"8c27bc28-4fdc-4e3c-be34-80e58f97899c","title":"Ying Cong Seah on Almost Shutting Down His Start-Up Three Years After Dropping Out of Penn (Part Two)","slug":"ying-cong-part2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"_3 Min Read_\\n\\n[Back to Part 1: Ying Cong Seah on Setting Goals as a 24-year-old CTO](http://thesign.al/ying-cong)\\n\\n<h4>What you can do today:</h4>\\n<table class=\\\"bordered\\\">\\n\\n <tr>\\n        <td>1)</td>      \\n        <td>If you want to do something, just do it directly because usually there's no substitute for it.</td>\\n<td><a href=\\\"#1\\\"><button class=\\\"button1\\\" style=\\\"align:center\\\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\\n    </tr>        \\n    <tr>\\n        <td>2)</td>     \\n        <td>Know clearly if you are in your career to learn or to earn.</td>\\n<td><a href=\\\"#2\\\"><button class=\\\"button1\\\" style=\\\"align:center\\\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\\n    </tr>\\n\\n<tr></td>\\n    </tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n\\n**What motivated you to drop out after freshman year at Penn?

Glints is growing and expanding to new markets. I see it being far more exciting than continuing my college education. College is fine, but I can always go back. \\n \\n**You said that for entrepreneurship, there are no transferable skills. Can you elaborate on that?**\\n\\nIt is very difficult for you to pick up the skills you need to be an entrepreneur via any other path.

After that you take a break for a little while, and then you repeat the cycle but for a different topic. This is the kind of rhythm I want to pursue for the rest of my life. Maybe I'll go back to finish up my bachelor degree and put whatever I have learned into practice, maybe in the next start-up. Then take a few years off and maybe go for a Masters.

The highs and lows?** \\n \\nWe raised series A last year.  This is a major milestone for me emotionally, not simply because we raised the funds, but because we were really close to shutting the business down since we were running out of cash. We were facing a lot of problems internally and we thought that the startup was not going to go on. A lot of employees were losing faith in the business. \\n\\nThe three of us had a chat and we decided we are not going to let this business fail, that we're going to push on no matter what. Then we started taking massive action to make things happen, and we eventually closed the round. \\n \\nWe also managed to raise our lead revenue to a point where the business was no longer dying, where it was actually much healthier. Before, we were relying on some government policies to sell our products and the policy changed literally overnight without any pre-warning, which cut off one of our main sources of revenue, causing us to lose a lot of money in a short period of time. As you know, cash flow is king especially in a startup, and that nearly killed us. So raising series A made us survive for another day. That was emotionally a triumph for me. \\n \\nA milestone for us on the on the product side was expanding. Singapore has been a very comfortable, but limited market. Expanding to Indonesia, setting up a team there and closing our first series there made it clear to us that we are finally becoming a regional business. \\n \\nWhen we were running out cash, the three of us had to put money into the company to keep it going and pay salaries for the end of the month. It was not only financially stressful but also emotionally because we felt like we were letting our parents down. I felt like I made the wrong decision to give up our schools and scholarships for an idea that is unproven. \\n \\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n\\n**Do you have anything else you would like to share with students?** \\n\\nMy advice to students would be my advice for myself three years ago, or when I started at Penn: Don't be afraid to explore the world and don't be afraid to be vulnerable and expose yourself to different domains.\\n\\nI have been out for three years in the wild and interacting with the wildest groups of people. I realized the world is a lot different and a lot bigger than I have ever imagined. Growing up in Singapore under the academic system, I found myself always interacting with the same kind of people who do well in school and come from good family backgrounds, then eventually end up in the same jobs. When you put your eyes out there and start talking to people who are vastly different from you but also impressive in their own ways, then you realize: \\n\\n>==Wow, actually, you can live your life in a very different way and still find a lot of meaning in what you do.== \\n\\nSo my advice is don’t be afraid to explore in terms of your career. \\n\\nOne of my mentors gave me this advice: \\n\\n>==When you go out for your career, you have to know very clearly whether you are there to earn or if you are there to learn, because usually those two don’t go together.==\\n\\nYou have to be clear where you are at, so I would recommend for most students that their first job out of college should be to learn, and once they’ve learned enough, earn.

And when I got out of college, unemployment was quite high really. I went home with my wife and said, “Why don't I try freelancing?” Sometimes you bend with the wind and it turned out to be quite good. I ended up covering the Senate, the White House, and Congress. Particularly interesting at the time, the Watergate hearings were ongoing and it was a great training ground that taught me to understand what mattered — what's important about this particular hearing? Who are the important people? What kind of a photo do they want from that? \\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/YDhJ7nT.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Gene Jeffers\\\" style=\\\"width:100%;height:100%\\\">\\n*A photo by Gene Jeffers of a flood in Kentucky in the late 1970s.*\\n\\n**What motivated you to make the shift from photojournalism and media to nonprofit management?**\\n \\nI started finding that the path for strictly photography was pretty limited. If I were to stay as a photographer, it would mean spending an awful lot of time away from my wife and growing family. I looked to the magazines and it just so happened that the Red Cross National Headquarters was looking for a photographer. I started there in the 1970s as a staff photographer for four years but I soon realized that what I was doing with the field slowly expanded into more and more PR work on an informal level — I was creating stories, writing notes about them, passing them along to the PR shop. I went back to school for my master's degree in journalism and as I was completing it, a position in the PR department opened up with the Red Cross. I thought yeah let's go beyond just taking pictures and let's start working with words. \\n\\nAfter a major reorganization at national headquarters, I eventually ended up as the head of media relations with exciting work. We were in the midst of a number of crises like the major famine in Africa and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic and its relationship to blood collection. Dealing with these crises really prepared me when eventually the National Association of Broadcasters recruited me away to take a job as a V.P. with them. It got me really into the management line and I ended up coming out to Los Angeles to work with the Western Insurance Information Service Centers. But I soon learned that the insurance industry and I don't exactly mix well so I went over to lead at a local Red Cross chapter that had collapsed to get them back on their feet.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/tbdvTGjg.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Gene Jeffers\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%\\\">\\n*A photo by Gene Jeffers of a boy who was helped by the Red Cross in the early 1980s.*\\n\\n**With the variety of professional roles you’ve served in, have you noticed any common skills or themes that have tied everything together?**\\n\\nI think the main thrust of most of the work I've done is connecting people. Connecting people to ideas, events, or other people would be the core work I've done — whether as a freelance photographer connecting people to what was happening in the Senate and Congress at the White House or as a relations manager with the National Red Cross. The primary focus is helping industry people find each other, network with each other, and do business together.\\n\\nSecond, I’ve learned that it’s a lot easier to ask somebody for advice than it is to ask for a job. It's just an easier conversation for both sides of the equation and often times the person you go to for advice has other ideas for you to check out. “Gee, I don't have anything here at my company now but you should go talk to Bill Jones down the street at that company, I know he’s looking for something like that.” That happens a lot and, again, you're not putting pressure on that person to hire you. We all like to give advice. We all hate to say no, I don't have a job for you. It's a much different conversation when you approach it that way.\\n \\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n\\n**What was the experience like going back to school for your MBA and how does it differ from the kind of learning you would do on the job?**\\n \\nFor me there were a number of really positive things that came out of it. The first one is that whether we like to admit it or not, the initials after your name do mean something. For example, when I took over at the Red Cross chapter that had collapsed, I went out and recruited a new board for the first stage of the business, with several members holding their MBA.

I started there in the 1970s as a staff photographer for four years but I soon realized that what I was doing with the field slowly expanded into more and more PR work on an informal level — I was creating stories, writing notes about them, passing them along to the PR shop.

I remember talking to a career advisor at Yale. He said basically life happens. You might think that the Peace Corps is something you can do at any time and certainly anyone over eighteen can join. However, life's going to happen, you’re going to have obligations, you’ll have mortgage payments and you might not be able to step away for two years. You've got a chance now so take it. \\n\\n**How did the Peace Corps influence your later work and change your perspective or mindset?**\\n \\nIt absolutely reframed the way I saw things. I was surprised that it showed me my distinctive American-ness. I never felt more American than when I was in China. I realized how many things I took for granted, how many assumptions I carried with me about how the world works that are not necessarily shared elsewhere. But at the same time, the Peace Corps made everything feel closer. To go to a place that was so unknown to me and learn enough language to have meaningful conversations, to develop meaningful relationships, and to be able to learn from people while teaching them a little bit about myself really shows you something optimistic about the world. It really shrunk my sense of how big the globe was. You realize that despite some very deep cultural differences, you also uncover this great vein of shared humanity and shared priorities. Frankly, you see the vast reach of American culture and I came back feeling that China had never been nearly as far away as I had thought. \\n\\n>==I think being in the Peace Corps developed that instinct to reach beyond my immediate comfort zone and showed me that doing so is not only not scary, but rewarding and actually really fun.== \\n\\nIt certainly informed the startup work that I did in media: Tea Leaf Nation, which essentially formed a cultural bridge between Western readers and China, and the work I'm doing now at The Lenfest Institute, bringing underrepresented voices into the media conversation. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n\\n**With Tea Leaf Nation, what were you trying to accomplish, and what did you see as the most important part of the culture bridging work that you were doing?**\\n\\nWe were taking on a task that was fast, ambitious, and that no single website could ever possibly accomplish, which was to provide a bridge of understanding between East and West. I learned that when you do service work your goal should not be to solve problems — it should be to address problems that are meaningful to you. I learned this in the Peace Corps. My mom always told me this. She had been a social worker for decades and learned the hard way that if you try to fix things by yourself you're probably in for a rude surprise. If you focus not on the output but on the input, if you are doing everything to work on a problem that is of value to you, you're going to be a lot more satisfied.  \\n\\nWith Tea Leaf Nation, we were addressing a problem that was important to my founders and I, which was this general need for better information that showed some of the strains of thought and discussion going on inside China. A lot of the reporting about China focuses on the Chinese government, which is increasingly illiberal, but that doesn't show you everything about the country. That doesn't show the human beings in that country, what they’re struggling with on a daily basis, and what they are thinking about.

I was surprised that it showed me my distinctive American-ness. I never felt more American than when I was in China. I realized how many things I took for granted, how many assumptions I carried with me about how the world works that are not necessarily shared elsewhere. But at the same time, the Peace Corps made everything feel closer. To go to a place that was so unknown to me and learn enough language to have meaningful conversations, to develop meaningful relationships, and to be able to learn from people while teaching them a little bit about myself really shows you something optimistic about the world. It really shrunk my sense of how big the globe was. You realize that despite some very deep cultural differences, you also uncover this great vein of shared humanity and shared priorities.

My mom always told me this. She had been a social worker for decades and learned the hard way that if you try to fix things by yourself you're probably in for a rude surprise.

I think nowadays, there’s so much emphasis on doing something super technical in college. The job market is getting tough and graduating with computer science skills is of course going to help, but what I loved about Psychology is that you learn how to think, or even to think. I think a lot of students go through education, K through 12, kind of being told what we need to learn – memorizing this and that – there’s not as much critical thinking that is encouraged as I think there should be. But once you leave college, that’s all you’re going to be doing. There’s no set formula in life or at work. If you really want to do something innovative and something that really creates value, critical thinking is such a necessity. \\n\\nStudying Psychology, something I got to do junior year was to create my own experiments. My thesis was on persuasion and for the first time, I thought it was amazing how I was getting to create knowledge, versus just absorbing what has already been created and written for me to read in a textbook. It required a lot of thinking, like how do I design an experiment? What is a good way to write out a hypothesis? How do you read data? These are the skills that carry you far in life. Learning how to read significance, interpreting results – these skills really helped me in my career, especially as an entrepreneur, where we’re constantly experimenting.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n**Tell us about your experience as an Asian American woman and how that has influenced your entrepreneurship journey.**\\n\\nParents are like your world when you’re growing up and they have a huge influence on you. I grew up watching my dad who lives and breathes his work and his passion. He would come into our room with a cardboard machine prototype that he had designed, saying, “Hey, I think if we actually design and plan this way, we could increase output in this way etc” and I didn’t exactly understand it as a little kid. But it was really fun seeing him super excited about trying out different methodologies and constantly thinking about how to increase output. \\n\\nI also remember him during the financial crisis, when he had to lay off a lot of people – I saw him write the speech that he was going to give to the company he had created from scratch, and I could tell that he was really nervous and he was really sad for a long time. So I grew up watching all this and knew that at some point in our lives, we will start something of our own and create something meaningful. But I am also Asian American and grew up in an environment where parents want you to go to an Ivy League school, work for a brand name company – there was that too, so when I went to Penn, I didn’t really think about going to work for a startup right after graduating. \\n\\nMy dad used to always say, “If a leaf is in a pond with still water, it is eventually going to rot; you have to be in moving water and that’s how I want you to live your life. And whatever happens, I got your back.” And that was so encouraging for me. I definitely attribute a lot of my success to the values I grew up with as an Asian American. Some things that are not great would be that I think we’re not really taught to toot our own horn, which can be really hard when it comes to pitching and sales.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"//i.imgur.com/kwZrg4gr.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Family Picture\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">The CMB founders with their dad.</p>*\\n\\nAs for being a female entrepreneur, I was really interested in learning computer science and went to CIS 101 at Penn and saw very little women. Instead of thinking there’s not that many women here, my thinking was that I don’t feel like I belong here, I don’t know if I qualify. There was also a lot of kids who were already very familiar with computers and programming...and I got a really bad grade. I had never programmed in my life, I was never into computer games, I wasn’t one of those people who would take out hardware in a computer and put it back to make their own computer. My thought process was, I didn’t do any of that growing up, so I’m not qualified here... so I’m going to quit. \\n\\nSo I quit. And I wish there had been someone who told me, “You just haven’t been exposed, because computer science is not something that is encouraged amongst women and if you didn’t grow up looking at female computer scientists, it’s easy to think that you don’t belong. So you just have to get used to it and if you learn it, you can do it.” When I was growing up, there was one person I knew who was really into computers – my cousin, and he was a guy. So, I wish there had been someone who told me that.\\n\\n**If your life was an epic, what are 2-3 pivotal scenes or moments that shaped who you are today?**\\n\\nThat’s a great question. I was thinking about this the other day because someone asked me, who do you want to give a shoutout to? Some of the people that I really want to give a shoutout to are those who created pivotal moments in my life. \\n\\nThis is kind of personal, but my parents separated when I was 9 years old and I ended up living with my grandmother and my sisters – I didn’t live with my parents since then and that had a huge impact on the type of person that I grew up to be. I’m very independent, mostly not afraid of being in a new environment, and I have a really special bond with my sisters that developed because our parents were not around. \\n\\nThen, I came to the states when I was 13 – that was a huge moment for me. Being able to speak English, just that in and of itself, creates so many more opportunities for us. I could have started CMB in Korea, but that would have been a very small market. I would have put in the same amount of effort, but just because it would be in Korean, it would have been so much harder – because I wouldn’t speak English fluently, I would probably not have gotten the opportunity to speak at Bloomberg and Forbes to share my story. Also, being in an environment with so many different nationalities and so many different types of people – people of color, people of different religions; Korea is a pretty homogeneous country, so coming here opened my eyes and helped me develop a global mindset.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\nThe next pivotal moment would be when I was at Avon and met my boss – Hannah. Having a great mentor is really important; she’s the one who introduced me to the world of MBA. I didn’t know what that was before, but one day, she pulled me aside and asked, “Have you thought about getting an MBA? It’s where you really get to learn business and build a network... it opened up so many opportunities for me, why don’t you try it?” I applied, she wrote my recommendation letter, and I got into Stanford.\\n\\nAt Stanford, there were so many people with a similar mindset of wanting to contribute to making a difference, people who were really smart and driven – this is all Penn too, but Penn is big and I think there’s a lot more diversity in terms of what people want to do. Not only did I get to build a really strong network, but with my startup also, I got so much support from my Stanford network – all my seed funding meetings were either with classmates or alums, so meeting Hannah and deciding to get an MBA was definitely a pivotal moment for me. And then of course starting Coffee Meets Bagel was another pivotal moment in my life. \\n\\n<img src=\\\"//i.imgur.com/Tpvp15v.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Shark Tank\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">The CMB founders on Shark Tank.</p>*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n**Any advice you would give to Penn students interested in starting their own business or working for a startup?**\\n\\n*1) Invest early in critical thinking.*\\n\\nI think there’s so much emphasis on something that is tangible and can be measured, that it seems nothing else matters.

Instead, there’s so much emphasis on constantly producing things. But when you leave school, no one is going to be telling you, “this is the right thing to do”, “you need to do this”, or “if you do it this way you get an A, if you do it that way you get a B”– that’s just not how life works. I think because we’re so used to that kind of a system, that’s all we know for the first 21 years of our lives, that it’s really hard to break away from that mindset.

It’s what you love, and I love movies. I’ve always had an almost encyclopedic memory of the movies I've watched since the time I was a kid. Growing up, going through high school, and even getting into Penn, which is a very linear institutional hierarchy, I was very good at chasing the wrong. I was also always the kid looking at the butterflies, staring out the window, and interrupting classes. I learned at a young age that I was an oral learner. I had to speak to learn, so I spent a lot of time being the class clown and talking a lot because that was my way of actually possessing information.\\n \\nEverybody else seemed very content with their classes and the idea that you do work and then it's almost binary. You turn on a switch to turn it off. But for me, it was always like there were all these corridors opening up in my mind. I get to Penn, where I'm taking a lot of film theory classes, largely because I love movies. But there wasn't a screenwriting major. There was no major that allowed you to “make believe.” I'm doing it largely because that's what people tell you when you go off to college—take the courses that interest you. It's such a profound thought. But then you sit there with your advisor or your parents or friends and everybody's telling you that you should be doing this or doing that. I think in movies and I dream of movies. I live my life, not just as a writer trying to make movies, but of all the movies I've possessed.\\n\\nIn my mind, it's almost like I didn't have a choice and I didn't know it when I was younger. If anything, there were all of these voices in my head telling me to snap out of it. You're at an Ivy League school, so you should work on Wall Street or become a lawyer. When I was younger, nothing really satisfied me. I went to work in an office right out of college and within six months, I could remember crying in the office bathroom because I felt so claustrophobic and I didn't know why. if anything, my career and my life was less of a cognitive choice and more of a nervous system choice.\\n\\nI had to get out to Los Angeles because I didn't have to explain myself there. In New York or Philadelphia, if I said I wanted to write movies, I would get this look back at me and people would ask, well when are you going to get a real job? In Los Angeles, at least there are so many people trying to do the same thing. Moving out to LA was a huge demarcation point to me where it could become more of a reality.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.lacity.org/sites/g/files/wph781/f/styles/tiled_homepage_blog/public/bigstock-Los-Angeles-5909078.jpg?itok=Pu2dewLz\\\" alt=\\\"Alec Sokolow\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Moving to LA was a huge turning point for Sokolow.</p>*\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div> \\n**It definitely happens here where you have the pressure of being at Penn and if you don't go into law or banking or something that \\\"pays off,\\\" or is a real job, people think it's a waste. You talked about how you almost went to a law school and succumbed to those pressures, can you talk more about that?**\\n\\nI get through my four years of college, spend summers working as a production assistant on movies and television shows, major in communications, and basically do all of the things that everybody says you're supposed to do. But, by the time I finish my four years, I have no idea what's coming next. It's like you're on a field with all of this fresh snow and you get to make all of the footprints, and that gave me anxiety. I took my last college exam and instead of feeling this exalted crescendo of my education I was like well, I guess that's it. And I went and bought a beer. I didn’t really have a clear sense of myself or my life. Then the frying pan hits me in the face and I realize that this is my life and I have to figure it out.\\n \\nMy folks were very understanding. After I graduated and went back to live in my childhood room for a couple months, I said I had to get out of there. At that time I was really drawn more and more into writing. The first two or three years after college was such an emotional struggle for me because there was no hierarchy. There was no, if I just go up this ladder, then something good is going to happen. So I start writing monologues and skits and my folks, they’re supportive up to a point, but about a year after college they said I should apply to law school and I did. I took the LSATs and I got into several law schools in the New York City area. And as that was happening, I was feverishly writing and trying to just get my toe in the door. Eventually I did so I put away that safety net and then commenced my professional career. For me, one of the great failures of my education was that it had no practical application to my life. It was all theoretical. Then when I got out of college, I realized I couldn't work in an office and survive emotionally. I didn't care about law in that way. Even now, when I'm writing I'm not on Earth. I'm in some other zone or some beautiful place in my head.\\n \\nI don't know if I was capable of doing anything else and comically, I wanted to quit a million times. This is a hard life. You're being judged constantly and there's no security. Raising a family, you have all these other pressures. I had different points in my adult life where I reached out to people in academia asking what else could I do? l I found out my skill set is writing movies. That's what I do really well. I had the benefit of confidence and the grit and stubbornness to allow me to struggle, suffer, and ultimately learn the craft. Toy Story came out when I was thirty two so I spent a decade learning how to be a writer.\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div> \\n**Toy Story obviously became really successful. Did you feel like all of the courageous choices you made were validated at that point? Did the career doubts stop for you?**\\n \\nI think so a little bit. Initially, I felt like I had to defend myself. I’m writing and I see people I went to school with at Penn and they were starting to really build their lives. They would ask if I was still writing, as if it was a choice. Then Toy Story happened and all of a sudden it changed to, well you're special, what other rays of genius will you provide? That was very hard initially because I didn't quite know what changed. The same people who were telling me I was horrible were now telling me I was great. I knew the second Toy Story came out and performed well that I didn't have to explain myself anymore. \\n\\nThe twenties were the hardest emotional decade for me because I wanted validation and a career. I wanted people to know what I could do and to be able to say this is what I've done. That doesn't mean writing gets easier and it doesn't mean that the business gets necessarily more satisfying, it just means I know who I am. It’s helped me a lot internally. And I think that when you do try to carve your own path, that sense of self validation is priceless. It allows you to discover who you really are. \\n \\nDon't become a screenwriter if you want to do it, become a screenwriter because you have to do it. I think when I look back on my periods at college or even just beyond, it was almost like by default this was what I was supposed to be doing. Only through time can I look back and realize that. I tried a lot of things and I felt like I was drowning emotionally.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://imgc.allpostersimages.com/img/print/posters/toy-story-woody-buzz_a-G-13390942-0.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Alec Sokolow\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">Sokolow wrote the scripts of the famous Toy Story franchise.</p>*\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n**Talking about your journey as a screenwriter and knowing a lot more now than you did back then, what advice do you have for students who want to explore screenwriting?**\\n \\nI think the key to life in America and life in capitalism is to become a brand. I would say that's the real inner game if you’re going to work in the entertainment industry. That might seem cynical, but I actually saw it as revelatory because it was almost like it became a game. Instead of being judged personally as a human being, it was almost like no I'm an animation writer or I'm a family writer or I do the talking animal stuff or any of those things that's the real key. There's so many lessons that you learned by living it and doing it this you can hear somebody talk about it but until you experience it, you won't really properly learn that lesson. But having said that, what is a screenplay? A screenplay is a sales document. It's a business plan. It's a marketing tool, but it's also a work of art and a narrative. If I'm lucky, one of my screenplays will be read by 20 people or be seen by millions. I write these documents that can make people laugh, but also that actors and directors might think it's worth their time and career on. Executives and producers might say I know how to make money on this. The marketing people might say, yes I know how to sell this and ultimately, the audience will might experience it and say I'm enjoying this. I became very obsessed at a young age with looking at all of the other movies that succeeded. I would try to break them down and figure out why they succeeded on the page. \\n \\nIt started a whole process that was an abstraction that was far removed from just writing words. I would say to also write every day or every week. Writing does not happen by itself. But do it knowing that you ultimately are trying to make yourself a brand or a nice shiny object that the marketplace wants to exploit. But by doing that, don't lose your humanity or become too cynical, but still see it as as a game that can be fun.\\n\\n**Your brand has evolved over time with more comedic movies like Garfield and Cheaper by the Dozen and recently you did I am Jane Doe, which is a very raw, emotional piece. You mentioned before that there were a lot of movies that helped you build this brand. Were there some movies that influenced you the most and what were the factors that helped you decide what was a story worth writing?**\\n \\nI didn’t know when I started, but I initially fought those family movies. I fought the Garfield movies. I fought it in my head because when I was growing up and dreaming of being a movie writer, I didn't think I would be working in that sector of the movie business. Yet what I've come to realize is, it's kind of what I do best. I realize it's because I have this inner child inside of me and I've really been in touch with that voice, so it's easy for me to think like a character that would be entertaining to an 8 or 12 year old. Hopefully I’m contributing to a positive conversation that kids can have with themselves as they're discovering the world. And a chance for the kids has to like very simple life lessons. But it's safe and it's fun. And it makes you want to hug your family. It makes you want to feel the sunshine a little bit more.\\n \\nWhen I was exposed to I am Jane Doe, which is about underage sex trafficking, I realized that I care a lot about kids and it angered me that this was going on. I realized that I care a lot about protecting kids and creating safety for them. It's not a coincidence that these are scripts I write.\\n \\nOne of my favorite movies of all time is a Buster Keaton movie called Sherlock Jr. It's just brilliant conceptually. It shows you everything that movies can be in a silent film form back in the 1920s. I'm a pretty empathetic guy, so I would watch movies up to every decade and they would hit me very deeply. I get out to Los Angeles and I'm working on some late night TV and doing this and that and then I'm trying to break into the movie business. Then I meet Joel Collins, who becomes a long term collaborator of mine. We started very thorough conversations about how to be successful screenwriters and it was like just two idiots on a park bench talking about what movies Hollywood has made throughout time and space and what are the movies that get you the best chance of getting your name on the credits. In our analysis, we decided on the buddy movie. Our first script became the comedy, Money Talks. Our second script never got sold or made, but it had the characters Buzz and Woody in it. That script became the writing sample that got us to Toy Story. Both of them were Buddy constructs. The basic rule of a buddy story is that you have these two polar opposites, a left brain character and a right brain character and they're not supposed to like each other. You have these two polarities and then you get a bigger force, a boss, or an event that handcuffs these two characters together. When you look at Toy Story, it was the two toys and the boy handcuffing these toys together.\\n \\nA buddy story is algorithm of trust and ability. I focused a lot on that. But I love so many different movies and I get inspiration from so many different movies. Actually one of the guilty pleasures of living the life I'm living is to be able to read as much as I read and watch as much as I watch and know that it's actually investing in me is amazing.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://www.50eggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/i-am-jane-doe.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Alec Sokolow\\\" style=\\\"width:75%;height:75%;margin-bottom:-25px;\\\">*<p align=\\\"center\\\">I Am Jane Doe, Sokolow's piece about underage sex trafficking.</p>*\\n\\n**If your life was a movie and there were two or three key events that really molded you to become who you are today, what would those be for you? Do you have one that changed your professional character drastically?**\\n \\nThat seven years or so out of Penn was such a daily struggle for me. Five months before Toy Story came out, when my wife was pregnant, there was a moment where we had 11 dollars in the bank. I had to pawn some things just to get money for food to get through the weekend. It doesn't mean that I didn't know good things were coming. That in a way is probably the most defining thing as a writer is saying, “I have nowhere to go, but forward.” It still haunts me, but I'm proud of that. \\n\\nYou've got to live your life and when people said that to me when I young, I either understood or didn't but life is going to happen and everybody's going to face a million choices in their lives. For some people, going the more traditional, institutional career route is the only way to go. For some people it's not, and I was one of those other people. The real evolution started when I got out.\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Alec Sokolow graduated from Penn with a B.A. in Communications in 1985.

The basic rule of a buddy story is that you have these two polar opposites, a left brain character and a right brain character and they're not supposed to like each other.

He began\nhis writing career as a writer for National Lampoon Magazine and segment\nproducer on The Late Show. Most notably, he is the author or co-author of 47\nscreenplays including Toy Story, which received an Academy Award nomination for\nscreenwriting, Cheaper By the Dozen, and Garfield. Most recently, he co-wrote I\nam Jane Doe, a documentary on sex trafficking of underage girls in the United\nStates. This past Fall, Alec spoke at the Kelly Writer's House to a room packed\nwith aspiring student writers.\n\nStories To Note\n1)  \n The pressures of finding a \"real job.\"\n Read\n 2)  \n The journey to get to Toy Story.\n Read\n 3)  \n Advice to aspiring screenwriters and creators.\n Read\n Alec Sokolow.\n\n\n\nHow did you decide you wanted to become a film writer?\n\nWhen you talk about writing scripts, or anything in the arts, it starts with\npassion. It’s what you love, and I love movies. I’ve always had an almost\nencyclopedic memory of the movies I've watched since the time I was a kid.\nGrowing up, going through high school, and even getting into Penn, which is a\nvery linear institutional hierarchy, I was very good at chasing the wrong. I was\nalso always the kid looking at the butterflies, staring out the window, and\ninterrupting classes. I learned at a young age that I was an oral learner. I had\nto speak to learn, so I spent a lot of time being the class clown and talking a\nlot because that was my way of actually possessing information.\n\nEverybody else seemed very content with their classes and the idea that you do\nwork and then it's almost binary. You turn on a switch to turn it off. But for\nme, it was always like there were all these corridors opening up in my mind. I\nget to Penn, where I'm taking a lot of film theory classes, largely because I\nlove movies. But there wasn't a screenwriting major. There was no major that\nallowed you to “make believe.” I'm doing it largely because that's what people\ntell you when you go off to college—take the courses that interest you. It's\nsuch a profound thought. But then you sit there with your advisor or your\nparents or friends and everybody's telling you that you should be doing this or\ndoing that. I think in movies and I dream of movies. I live my life, not just as\na writer trying to make movies, but of all the movies I've possessed.\n\nIn my mind, it's almost like I didn't have a choice and I didn't know it when I\nwas younger. If anything, there were all of these voices in my head telling me\nto snap out of it. You're at an Ivy League school, so you should work on Wall\nStreet or become a lawyer. When I was younger, nothing really satisfied me. I\nwent to work in an office right out of college and within six months, I could\nremember crying in the office bathroom because I felt so claustrophobic and I\ndidn't know why. if anything, my career and my life was less of a cognitive\nchoice and more of a nervous system choice.\n\nI had to get out to Los Angeles because I didn't have to explain myself there.\nIn New York or Philadelphia, if I said I wanted to write movies, I would get\nthis look back at me and people would ask, well when are you going to get a real\njob? In Los Angeles, at least there are so many people trying to do the same\nthing. Moving out to LA was a huge demarcation point to me where it could become\nmore of a reality.\n\nMoving to LA was a huge turning point for Sokolow.\n\n\n\n**It definitely happens here where you have the pressure of being at Penn and if\nyou don't go into law or banking or something that \"pays off,\" or is a real job,\npeople think it's a waste. You talked about how you almost went to a law school\nand succumbed to those pressures, can you talk more about that?**I get through\nmy four years of college, spend summers working as a production assistant on\nmovies and television shows, major in communications, and basically do all of\nthe things that everybody says you're supposed to do. But, by the time I finish\nmy four years, I have no idea what's coming next. It's like you're on a field\nwith all of this fresh snow and you get to make all of the footprints, and that\ngave me anxiety. I took my last college exam and instead of feeling this exalted\ncrescendo of my education I was like well, I guess that's it. And I went and\nbought a beer. I didn’t really have a clear sense of myself or my life. Then the\nfrying pan hits me in the face and I realize that this is my life and I have to\nfigure it out.\n\nMy folks were very understanding. After I graduated and went back to live in my\nchildhood room for a couple months, I said I had to get out of there. At that\ntime I was really drawn more and more into writing. The first two or three years\nafter college was such an emotional struggle for me because there was no\nhierarchy. There was no, if I just go up this ladder, then something good is\ngoing to happen. So I start writing monologues and skits and my folks, they’re\nsupportive up to a point, but about a year after college they said I should\napply to law school and I did. I took the LSATs and I got into several law\nschools in the New York City area. And as that was happening, I was feverishly\nwriting and trying to just get my toe in the door. Eventually I did so I put\naway that safety net and then commenced my professional career. For me, one of\nthe great failures of my education was that it had no practical application to\nmy life. It was all theoretical. Then when I got out of college, I realized I\ncouldn't work in an office and survive emotionally. I didn't care about law in\nthat way. Even now, when I'm writing I'm not on Earth. I'm in some other zone or\nsome beautiful place in my head.\n\nI don't know if I was capable of doing anything else and comically, I wanted to\nquit a million times. This is a hard life. You're being judged constantly and\nthere's no security. Raising a family, you have all these other pressures. I had\ndifferent points in my adult life where I reached out to people in academia\nasking what else could I do? l I found out my skill set is writing movies.\nThat's what I do really well. I had the benefit of confidence and the grit and\nstubbornness to allow me to struggle, suffer, and ultimately learn the craft.\nToy Story came out when I was thirty two so I spent a decade learning how to be\na writer.\n\n**Toy Story obviously became really successful. Did you feel like all of the\ncourageous choices you made were validated at that point? Did the career doubts\nstop for you?**I think so a little bit. Initially, I felt like I had to defend\nmyself. I’m writing and I see people I went to school with at Penn and they were\nstarting to really build their lives. They would ask if I was still writing, as\nif it was a choice. Then Toy Story happened and all of a sudden it changed to,\nwell you're special, what other rays of genius will you provide? That was very\nhard initially because I didn't quite know what changed. The same people who\nwere telling me I was horrible were now telling me I was great. I knew the\nsecond Toy Story came out and performed well that I didn't have to explain\nmyself anymore.\n\nThe twenties were the hardest emotional decade for me because I wanted\nvalidation and a career. I wanted people to know what I could do and to be able\nto say this is what I've done. That doesn't mean writing gets easier and it\ndoesn't mean that the business gets necessarily more satisfying, it just means I\nknow who I am. It’s helped me a lot internally. And I think that when you do try\nto carve your own path, that sense of self validation is priceless. It allows\nyou to discover who you really are.\n\nDon't become a screenwriter if you want to do it, become a screenwriter because\nyou have to do it. I think when I look back on my periods at college or even\njust beyond, it was almost like by default this was what I was supposed to be\ndoing. Only through time can I look back and realize that. I tried a lot of\nthings and I felt like I was drowning emotionally.\n\nSokolow wrote the scripts of the famous Toy Story franchise.\n\n\n\n**Talking about your journey as a screenwriter and knowing a lot more now than\nyou did back then, what advice do you have for students who want to explore\nscreenwriting?**I think the key to life in America and life in capitalism is to\nbecome a brand. I would say that's the real inner game if you’re going to work\nin the entertainment industry. That might seem cynical, but I actually saw it as\nrevelatory because it was almost like it became a game. Instead of being judged\npersonally as a human being, it was almost like no I'm an animation writer or\nI'm a family writer or I do the talking animal stuff or any of those things\nthat's the real key. There's so many lessons that you learned by living it and\ndoing it this you can hear somebody talk about it but until you experience it,\nyou won't really properly learn that lesson. But having said that, what is a\nscreenplay? A screenplay is a sales document. It's a business plan. It's a\nmarketing tool, but it's also a work of art and a narrative. If I'm lucky, one\nof my screenplays will be read by 20 people or be seen by millions. I write\nthese documents that can make people laugh, but also that actors and directors\nmight think it's worth their time and career on. Executives and producers might\nsay I know how to make money on this. The marketing people might say, yes I know\nhow to sell this and ultimately, the audience will might experience it and say\nI'm enjoying this. I became very obsessed at a young age with looking at all of\nthe other movies that succeeded. I would try to break them down and figure out\nwhy they succeeded on the page.\n\nIt started a whole process that was an abstraction that was far removed from\njust writing words. I would say to also write every day or every week. Writing\ndoes not happen by itself. But do it knowing that you ultimately are trying to\nmake yourself a brand or a nice shiny object that the marketplace wants to\nexploit. But by doing that, don't lose your humanity or become too cynical, but\nstill see it as as a game that can be fun.\n\nYour brand has evolved over time with more comedic movies like Garfield and\nCheaper by the Dozen and recently you did I am Jane Doe, which is a very raw,\nemotional piece. You mentioned before that there were a lot of movies that\nhelped you build this brand. Were there some movies that influenced you the most\nand what were the factors that helped you decide what was a story worth writing?\n\nI didn’t know when I started, but I initially fought those family movies. I\nfought the Garfield movies. I fought it in my head because when I was growing up\nand dreaming of being a movie writer, I didn't think I would be working in that\nsector of the movie business. Yet what I've come to realize is, it's kind of\nwhat I do best. I realize it's because I have this inner child inside of me and\nI've really been in touch with that voice, so it's easy for me to think like a\ncharacter that would be entertaining to an 8 or 12 year old. Hopefully I’m\ncontributing to a positive conversation that kids can have with themselves as\nthey're discovering the world. And a chance for the kids has to like very simple\nlife lessons. But it's safe and it's fun. And it makes you want to hug your\nfamily. It makes you want to feel the sunshine a little bit more.\n\nWhen I was exposed to I am Jane Doe, which is about underage sex trafficking, I\nrealized that I care a lot about kids and it angered me that this was going on.\nI realized that I care a lot about protecting kids and creating safety for them.\nIt's not a coincidence that these are scripts I write.\n\nOne of my favorite movies of all time is a Buster Keaton movie called Sherlock\nJr. It's just brilliant conceptually. It shows you everything that movies can be\nin a silent film form back in the 1920s. I'm a pretty empathetic guy, so I would\nwatch movies up to every decade and they would hit me very deeply.

The big takeaway: Freshman year summer is built on a personal network.  If you know someone, they can finesse you something quickly.  So who has what isn't necessarily a function of who's more impressive than the other, but instead it's about who you know.  So, if you don't know anyone, that's completely ok, there are so many other options.  Take classes, do research, build your own entrepreneurial venture, or even better, DO ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME!  That's a super busy and exhilarating summer, will teach you a bunch, be great for a resume, and most importantly, ANYONE CAN DO IT.

I taught students in grades K-8 in suburban St. Louis math, robotics, and coding. I also piloted robotics camps in urban St. Louis for underprivileged students who otherwise could not afford these camps. It was very rewarding to get to know the students and watch their progress (especially the kids in the city). By working here my freshman summer, I took part in interesting, fun, and valuable work, that truthfully I probably enjoyed more than I would have enjoyed working in D.C.

For example, working as an RA was very quiet and although the\nwork was interesting, I preferred working with people as a tour guide. I learned\nthe most doing work for the Admissions Office, because I suddenly gained a lot\nof responsibility and was given the freedom to spearhead new projects. The\nadults in the office took me seriously and valued my opinions, so my confidence\ngrew as I implemented more ideas. Because the Admissions Office is part of a\nlarge bureaucratic system, I also gained exposure to the limitations of a large\nsystem and how to manage relationships with multiple departments and compromise.\nFurthermore, juggling these three responsibilities, I learned how to manage my\ntime better and a truer meaning of hard work. Additionally, I wish I had taken\nmy personal health more seriously. When my work/school life got really busy, my\nroom would be a mess and my eating habits got really out of whack. I often\nshoved away exercise and personal time to get more work done and this was really\nunhealthy behavior that I didn't realize at the time!”  Contact Andrea\n[writers+Andrea@thesignal.com]\n\nBrian Chau on taking easier summer courses (Penn classes): \"I would say the\nclasses themselves weren't incredibly useful but the great thing about getting\nrequirements out of the way is that it allowed me to have a lighter course load\naround OCR periods (junior and senior year). In addition, summer courses tend to\nbe easier so you can argue that it also helped my GPA vs. if I had taken them\nnormally during the fall/spring semesters. If I could go back, I would still\ntake classes but also do research with a Wharton professor in a field that I am\ninterested in on the side.

The advice was to follow the science and see where it might lead you. I went to Penn as an undergraduate studying chemistry and looked towards the possibility of medical school to use my knowledge of chemistry for health care and taking care of patients. I was fortunate to have had good experiences. I was good at chemistry; I loved medical school; I loved taking care of patients. I moved in that direction quickly going to Columbia University Medical School and then to the Massachusetts General Hospital for residency. By that time I was sure I wanted to do clinical medicine and take care of patients.\\n\\nThat was my direction until I went to the National Institutes of Health and had an opportunity to work with Earl Stadtman who was an amazing biochemist and an amazing teacher. He showed me how to use every instrument I would need, we talked about experiments I would do, and he even gave me the textbook that he used for his Ph.D. I was really surprised at how interested I became in the research. Although I was taking care of heart patients during that period, I spent more and more of my time in the laboratory, and I was hooked by the research. I was very excited that I could find things in the laboratory that eventually would allow me to do something in health. \\n\\n\\n**How did you make the transition from academia to industry?**\\n\\nI remained at NIH for a total of ten years before going to Washington University in St. Louis Missouri with the idea that I would be closer to patients and medicine again because while I loved doing research, I had guilt feelings about not taking care of patients. That’s why in 1975, when I had a call from old friends at Merck to consider the job as Head of Research I initially was not at all interested in leaving academia and joining a company. But the headquarters was in Rahway, New Jersey and I remembered the Merck people at our family restaurant talking about exciting research on vitamins and early antibiotics. I was relatively knowledgeable about the topic and when Merck called, the hook to be able to visit my parents in Rahway, NJ, next door was pretty good. \\n\\nI made the visit and noticed that drug discovery was not using enough biochemistry – which could be a much better strategy in my opinion. Pharmaceutical companies at the time used animal models of human disease. They were not focused on individual molecules which was the biochemical approach. And so I met with the CEO and told him that if I came to Merck I would change the approach to drug discovery. I asked if that would be acceptable. He said “yes, if we did not want major change we would not be talking.” \\n\\nI then asked him, what would happen if the business went flat? He replied: “we would cut back on all aspects of the business: marketing, sales, manufacturing and the staff groups. The last thing we would do is cut back expenses on research because research is our future.”\\n \\nI was impressed by that and agreed – the future of healthcare is going to be dependent on research. That's got to be an exciting place to be. So I accepted the job and promptly worked on switching all the projects in research to using a biochemical approach for drug discovery.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/2qz7sl4.png?2\\\" alt=\\\"Roy Vagelos\\\" style=\\\"width:100%;height:100%\\\">\\n*Dr. Vagelos interning at Merck Research Labs in Rahway, NJ after his first year of medical school at Columbia University (1951)*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n\\n**How has your background in research and medicine influenced how you make business decisions?** \\n\\nMy background as a physician was incredibly important because what was most important for me was the welfare of the patients. Nothing else would get in the way of that. \\n\\nIvermectin, now named Mectizan, for example, was a drug we discovered that was able to control the parasite that caused river blindness in millions of patients. Our experiments showed that Ivermectin was capable of preventing blindness if given as a single dose once a year. We were sure we could sell the drug at a low price to even poor people. But that was naive. The parasite infected populations where the patients had no money at all, many living in remote villages in sub-Saharan Africa. We went to visit these patients and soon realized that, having finished all our studies and preparing to release Ivermectin for use, no one would be able to afford it even for a dollar per year - even a half dollar a year would not do it. \\n\\nAnd so I made the decision that the company would not allow costs to be a barrier for these people. Merck would provide the drug free to anyone in the world for as long as it was required. That decision was made in 1987, and now 30 years later, the treatment numbers have grown with the company treating 250 million people in 2015 alone. Now that was a doctor making a decision, not a business person.\\n\\n**How did you balance the financial opposition for that decision with your moral responsibility for the patients?** \\n\\nTo justify the decision for shareholders, we look at the potential benefits and potential downsides to the company. The downside for not following through with the decision would be a negative message to your researchers and people of the company. \\n\\n>==The motto of Merck, that “medicine is for the patient, not for the profits,” would be a mockery. There was no way that we were not going to get that drug to the patients.== \\n\\nThe upside of the decision, which we didn’t know at the time the decision was made, was the extraordinary impact it had on the people at Merck not only in research but in every part of the company. They loved that decision. They were at Merck because they want us to do good things for human health and what could be better than preventing a hundred million people from becoming blind? It also made it possible for Merck to recruit almost anyone we wanted, in every part of the company. People loved working in a company that was truly doing good things for humans and stood behind what they said. The shareholders benefited enormously because the quality of the people decide the quality of the company. Of course the company was also very successful and profitable from the sales of other important drugs in the developed world.\\n\\n\\n<div id=\\\"3\\\"></div>\\n\\n**Speaking more broadly about business decisions did you ever consider going back for an MBA?** \\n\\nI did. When I first went to Merck, Henry Gadsden, the CEO at the time, told me “Roy, if you’re going to be in this company, you ought to learn some business.” And I said okay, how would I do that? So they signed me up for Harvard Business School and I agreed to go, despite my official job at the time being Head of Research, where my responsibility was drug discovery. I entered Harvard Business School but only remained a few weeks. I quickly recognized that what I was learning wasn't going to help me at all in drug discovery. Thus, business school was a waste of my time. At that moment I had no idea I would ever enter the Merck business side. My interest was science and I left Harvard Business School. \\n\\n>==Most of the things that you do in your life and career you pick up along the way and you learn from your associates.==\\n\\nSo my understanding of marketing, sales, manufacturing, corporate law and especially finance came from working very closely with the top people in those areas and learning from them. Also, when you sit down with someone where you are the boss and ask them to brief you about the major things, you should understand their area and expertise. Not only do you get to know the material and person who’s teaching you, but you also give a message to the person who's teaching you that you respect their knowledge. \\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/0liJDZR.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Roy Vagelos\\\" style=\\\"width:100%;height:100%\\\">\\n*Dr. Vagelos listening to current Merck CEO, Ken Frazier, discuss the Mectizan donation timeline*\\n\\n<div id=\\\"4\\\"></div>\\n\\n**You mentioned learning a lot from those around you especially from ones in mentorship roles. What are some of the key lessons that you've learned from your mentors?**\\n\\nI would say the most important lesson I learned from Earl Stadtman, an amazing biochemist, teacher, and mentor at the National Institutes of Health, was how to work closely with other people, tell them what you know, and let them take full credit for their accomplishments. \\n\\nFor instance, when I was in university and at the NIH, my name was on every paper that came from our laboratories because I was deeply involved in all the details of the experiments carried out by my colleagues who worked with me. But when I went to Merck, I was in charge of many research people. As head of research, it was my job to participate in many of the experiments, suggesting direction, and suggesting specific experiments. Some research leaders put their name on all the papers. Publications are very critical for scientists. But when the head of research puts their name on a publication, it immediately reduces the value of the person who's working under you because you will be seen as the senior person.\\n\\nThe generous thing to do is to leave your name off the paper. I had a rule when I went to Merck in that I insisted my name never be on a publication. If you look at the rest of the industry, the opposite was the case; the head of research was always a co-author. That was my way of indicating that I will hold them responsible for a project. But give them 100% of the credit when they succeed. \\n\\n**Do you have any general life advice for students here at Penn?** \\n\\nRecognize early that your time at Penn gives you a good platform of knowledge, but that you will be learning new things the rest of your lives and your learning will not stop. That's what life is about -- I'm constantly working on things that I don't completely understand. But for me and many others, that’s exciting because it means I’m learning. \\n\\n>==So you're going to learn for the rest of your career; you're going to learn from people around you; and you’re going to learn to reciprocate and teach others.==\\n\\n*All photos used in this article courtesy of Roy Vagelos.*\\n\\n*Disclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

Before\nretiring from his leadership role in the early 1990s, Merck had become the\nworld’s leader in the pharmaceutical industry. Today, Dr. Vagelos serves as the\nChairman of the Board of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and maintains strong advocacy\nfor medical advancements through philanthropic activities spanning academia and\nindustry.\n\n*Photo courtesy of Roy Vagelos*Stories worth noting:\n1)  \n From research and patient care to paving direction at MerckRead\n 2)  \n Putting patients first in making business decisionsRead\n 3)  \n Choosing to drop Harvard Business School to focus on learning on the jobRead</tr>\n\n\n4)  \n Key lessons and words of advice for students at PennRead</tr>\n\n\nGoing back to the start, can you speak about your mindset wanting to be a\nphysician and researcher before you joined Merck?\n\nGrowing up my family owned a small restaurant in Rahway, New Jersey and while my\npaternal grandfather was a doctor in Greece, my immediate surroundings were the\nchemists and engineers from Merck who were our restaurant customers. The advice\nwas to follow the science and see where it might lead you. I went to Penn as an\nundergraduate studying chemistry and looked towards the possibility of medical\nschool to use my knowledge of chemistry for health care and taking care of\npatients. I was fortunate to have had good experiences. I was good at chemistry;\nI loved medical school; I loved taking care of patients. I moved in that\ndirection quickly going to Columbia University Medical School and then to the\nMassachusetts General Hospital for residency. By that time I was sure I wanted\nto do clinical medicine and take care of patients.\n\nThat was my direction until I went to the National Institutes of Health and had\nan opportunity to work with Earl Stadtman who was an amazing biochemist and an\namazing teacher. He showed me how to use every instrument I would need, we\ntalked about experiments I would do, and he even gave me the textbook that he\nused for his Ph.D. I was really surprised at how interested I became in the\nresearch. Although I was taking care of heart patients during that period, I\nspent more and more of my time in the laboratory, and I was hooked by the\nresearch. I was very excited that I could find things in the laboratory that\neventually would allow me to do something in health.\n\nHow did you make the transition from academia to industry?\n\nI remained at NIH for a total of ten years before going to Washington University\nin St. Louis Missouri with the idea that I would be closer to patients and\nmedicine again because while I loved doing research, I had guilt feelings about\nnot taking care of patients. That’s why in 1975, when I had a call from old\nfriends at Merck to consider the job as Head of Research I initially was not at\nall interested in leaving academia and joining a company. But the headquarters\nwas in Rahway, New Jersey and I remembered the Merck people at our family\nrestaurant talking about exciting research on vitamins and early antibiotics. I\nwas relatively knowledgeable about the topic and when Merck called, the hook to\nbe able to visit my parents in Rahway, NJ, next door was pretty good.\n\nI made the visit and noticed that drug discovery was not using enough\nbiochemistry – which could be a much better strategy in my opinion.\nPharmaceutical companies at the time used animal models of human disease. They\nwere not focused on individual molecules which was the biochemical approach. And\nso I met with the CEO and told him that if I came to Merck I would change the\napproach to drug discovery. I asked if that would be acceptable. He said “yes,\nif we did not want major change we would not be talking.”\n\nI then asked him, what would happen if the business went flat? He replied: “we\nwould cut back on all aspects of the business: marketing, sales, manufacturing\nand the staff groups. The last thing we would do is cut back expenses on\nresearch because research is our future.”\n\nI was impressed by that and agreed – the future of healthcare is going to be\ndependent on research. That's got to be an exciting place to be. So I accepted\nthe job and promptly worked on switching all the projects in research to using a\nbiochemical approach for drug discovery.\n\n*Dr. Vagelos interning at Merck Research Labs in Rahway, NJ after his first year\nof medical school at Columbia University (1951)*How has your background in\nresearch and medicine influenced how you make business decisions?\n\nMy background as a physician was incredibly important because what was most\nimportant for me was the welfare of the patients. Nothing else would get in the\nway of that.\n\nIvermectin, now named Mectizan, for example, was a drug we discovered that was\nable to control the parasite that caused river blindness in millions of\npatients. Our experiments showed that Ivermectin was capable of preventing\nblindness if given as a single dose once a year. We were sure we could sell the\ndrug at a low price to even poor people. But that was naive. The parasite\ninfected populations where the patients had no money at all, many living in\nremote villages in sub-Saharan Africa. We went to visit these patients and soon\nrealized that, having finished all our studies and preparing to release\nIvermectin for use, no one would be able to afford it even for a dollar per year\n- even a half dollar a year would not do it.\n\nAnd so I made the decision that the company would not allow costs to be a\nbarrier for these people. Merck would provide the drug free to anyone in the\nworld for as long as it was required. That decision was made in 1987, and now 30\nyears later, the treatment numbers have grown with the company treating 250\nmillion people in 2015 alone. Now that was a doctor making a decision, not a\nbusiness person.\n\nHow did you balance the financial opposition for that decision with your moral\nresponsibility for the patients?\n\nTo justify the decision for shareholders, we look at the potential benefits and\npotential downsides to the company. The downside for not following through with\nthe decision would be a negative message to your researchers and people of the\ncompany.\n\nThe motto of Merck, that “medicine is for the patient, not for the profits,”\nwould be a mockery. There was no way that we were not going to get that drug to\nthe patients.\n\nThe upside of the decision, which we didn’t know at the time the decision was\nmade, was the extraordinary impact it had on the people at Merck not only in\nresearch but in every part of the company. They loved that decision. They were\nat Merck because they want us to do good things for human health and what could\nbe better than preventing a hundred million people from becoming blind? It also\nmade it possible for Merck to recruit almost anyone we wanted, in every part of\nthe company. People loved working in a company that was truly doing good things\nfor humans and stood behind what they said. The shareholders benefited\nenormously because the quality of the people decide the quality of the company.\nOf course the company was also very successful and profitable from the sales of\nother important drugs in the developed world.\n\nSpeaking more broadly about business decisions did you ever consider going back\nfor an MBA?\n\nI did. When I first went to Merck, Henry Gadsden, the CEO at the time, told me\n“Roy, if you’re going to be in this company, you ought to learn some business.”\nAnd I said okay, how would I do that? So they signed me up for Harvard Business\nSchool and I agreed to go, despite my official job at the time being Head of\nResearch, where my responsibility was drug discovery. I entered Harvard Business\nSchool but only remained a few weeks. I quickly recognized that what I was\nlearning wasn't going to help me at all in drug discovery. Thus, business school\nwas a waste of my time. At that moment I had no idea I would ever enter the\nMerck business side. My interest was science and I left Harvard Business School.\n\nMost of the things that you do in your life and career you pick up along the way\nand you learn from your associates.\n\nSo my understanding of marketing, sales, manufacturing, corporate law and\nespecially finance came from working very closely with the top people in those\nareas and learning from them. Also, when you sit down with someone where you are\nthe boss and ask them to brief you about the major things, you should understand\ntheir area and expertise. Not only do you get to know the material and person\nwho’s teaching you, but you also give a message to the person who's teaching you\nthat you respect their knowledge.\n\n*Dr. Vagelos listening to current Merck CEO, Ken Frazier, discuss the Mectizan\ndonation timeline*You mentioned learning a lot from those around you especially\nfrom ones in mentorship roles. What are some of the key lessons that you've\nlearned from your mentors?\n\nI would say the most important lesson I learned from Earl Stadtman, an amazing\nbiochemist, teacher, and mentor at the National Institutes of Health, was how to\nwork closely with other people, tell them what you know, and let them take full\ncredit for their accomplishments.\n\nFor instance, when I was in university and at the NIH, my name was on every\npaper that came from our laboratories because I was deeply involved in all the\ndetails of the experiments carried out by my colleagues who worked with me. But\nwhen I went to Merck, I was in charge of many research people. As head of\nresearch, it was my job to participate in many of the experiments, suggesting\ndirection, and suggesting specific experiments. Some research leaders put their\nname on all the papers. Publications are very critical for scientists. But when\nthe head of research puts their name on a publication, it immediately reduces\nthe value of the person who's working under you because you will be seen as the\nsenior person.\n\nThe generous thing to do is to leave your name off the paper. I had a rule when\nI went to Merck in that I insisted my name never be on a publication. If you\nlook at the rest of the industry, the opposite was the case; the head of\nresearch was always a co-author. That was my way of indicating that I will hold\nthem responsible for a project. But give them 100% of the credit when they\nsucceed.\n\nDo you have any general life advice for students here at Penn?\n\nRecognize early that your time at Penn gives you a good platform of knowledge,\nbut that you will be learning new things the rest of your lives and your\nlearning will not stop. That's what life is about -- I'm constantly working on\nthings that I don't completely understand. But for me and many others, that’s\nexciting because it means I’m learning.\n\nSo you're going to learn for the rest of your career; you're going to learn from\npeople around you; and you’re going to learn to reciprocate and teach others.\n\nAll photos used in this article courtesy of Roy Vagelos.\n\nDisclaimers: The views presented here are solely those of the interviewee.

She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 1991 and started working for a big company in New York City before becoming “disillusioned with corporate life.” After a year of backpacking around the world, she moved to Palo Alto and have since been “hooked on the Valley way — combine big ideas, smart people, hard work, and a little bit of luck and great things will ensue.” Her adventures include dropping out of Stanford to co-found her first company, WeddingChannel.com, a gift-registry aggregator; starting another named Bella Pictures; and attending the Circus Center in San Francisco for contortionism.\\n\\n<h4>Stories worth noting:</h4>\\n<table class=\\\"bordered\\\">\\n\\n <tr>\\n        <td>1)</td>      \\n        <td>Venture capital vs. entrepreneurship.</td>\\n<td><a href=\\\"#1\\\"><button class=\\\"button1\\\" style=\\\"align:center\\\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\\n    </tr>        \\n    <tr>\\n        <td>2)</td>     \\n        <td>Avoiding burnout at the young, exciting age of 40.</td>\\n<td><a href=\\\"#2\\\"><button class=\\\"button1\\\" style=\\\"align:center\\\"><span>Read</span></button></a></td>\\n    </tr>\\n<tr>\\n\\n    </tr>\\n<tr></td>\\n    </tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n**One thing you said earlier really stuck out to me: You chose the path of least resistance and that ended up not working well for you. That's something a lot of people here can take note of. People do it because they aren't well informed about what else is out there and/or what they want to do. And so the Sign.al was made originally to tackle that. But the only solution I see to get students past that is to get them to know earlier.**\\n\\n**What's your advice on how students can learn earlier? What do you wish you did as an undergrad to get a more informed idea of what you want to do before you graduate?** \\n\\nIt's a great question that I actually don't know the answer to. I never looked back and said, \\\"I wish I had done something else during my college years.\\\"\\n\\n>==It was more about when it happened, recognizing it and then making sure that I managed my way out of it because I didn't want to wake up in eight years and still be there, knowing the whole time that it was not my passion.==\\n\\nSo, there's a few things. One is whatever anyone does, they should be really conscious about the choices that they're making. If you want to work on Wall Street or you want to be a management consultant, know what it is exactly that you’ll be doing and why you're doing it. You should go find out more about that thing you need to understand to make the right decision. There's so much that can be found online: readings, internships, speakers. There's so much access.\\n\\nSo when people are doing analyses of what their move should be, it should never be, “I don't know enough about blank even though I'm so interested and so I'll go take a different route.” That's just wasted time. There's nothing wrong with saying that I think one day I want to be an entrepreneur or blank. But right now, since I don't have the skills or the idea or the network yet, I'm going to go do this other thing because I'm going to learn a lot and I'm excited about that. That is okay.\\n\\n**That makes sense. For me, the deliberate decisions were driven by my experiences on a trip to explore the San Francisco tech industry, organized by Wharton, where I first met you. It really helped me and others on the trek understand what else is out there in the tech world that we wouldn't have understood from going to a bunch of info sessions at Penn, especially at Wharton, where they are more finance and consulting focused. Those were incredibly instrumental for me and I bet there's a lot of other resources out there that I just haven't come across yet.**\\n\\n*Editors Note: [Treks](http://whartontechclub.com/treks/), like the one I met Jenny on, that I recommend are Wharton SF Tech, Wharton LA Media & Entertainment, Wharton NYC Tech, and Penn Tech Trek.*\\n\\nThey are there. You just need to dig. There are so many great intern programs. Freestyle has one. We are a $60 million fund and we took in six college students and placed them in our portfolio companies. I definitely recommend you do an internship in this other world if you’re remotely interested. It’s a wonderful way to get exposure. \\n\\n**I wish I had heard this earlier because I had plenty of summers in which I could have done something unique. Everyone has competitive, pre-professional mindsets, thinking, \\\"If I think I want to do X full time, then I have to get a junior year internship in that industry so that I can prove I can do it full time, and so I have to get a sophomore year internship in that industry so that I can prove I do it junior year.\\\" And people keep pushing it back to where now even freshmen are concerned about their summer, that they can't get that internship which will then provide some kind of domino effect to a full-time opportunity.**\\n\\nTotally, totally. Once again, it's just so easy. Those firms come, they make you great offers, and all your friends are doing it. I get it and it's fine for a lot of people. \\n\\n>==But if you are interested in this other world or you don't even know if you are, but you want to know if you are, then you should absolutely try that because the traditional jobs will always be there.==\\n\\n<div id=\\\"1\\\"></div>\\n\\n**So you mentioned [Freestyle](http://freestyle.vc/). Let's talk more about your VC life. You started off in entrepreneurship, which is more operational work. Now as a VC, it’s all investing. What was your motivation behind the switch?**\\n\\nMy advice is if you think one day you want to be a VC — and this is super biased — you should learn how to operate. If you can be a founder, be a founder. If you can join a young startup and learn how to operate, do that. There's nothing like living it to then be on the other side and know what to look for in investing. You’ll be a good coach, having been there and done that. You can add more value with empathy and insight than you can if you just looking at it through the ivory tower.\\n\\n![alt](http://c93fea60bb98e121740fc38ff31162a8.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/freestyle_team.jpeg)\\n*Jenny with her co-partners of Freestyle VC.*\\n\\nI had done a few startups and now I am married and have three kids. Startup life is really hard for good balance. I get so much joy out of working with entrepreneurs and being the person behind the scenes that helps them be successful. \\n\\nFor young people, do things that are harder to do when you're older. Being an entrepreneur while you're young is just a hell of a lot easier to do than when you have a family and children and whatnot. \\n\\n<div id=\\\"2\\\"></div>\\n\\n**I definitely agree. I always thought that one of the most powerful things about being young and fresh out of college is that you have this energy and enthusiasm and passion to go out and solve a lot of things. Obviously, this is coming from a very grandiose mindset that I have as a 21-year-old right now, but this energy matters. Many different places I’ve worked at didn't push me creatively or to think outside of the box. Personally I call it \\\"feeling like an adult.\\\" That's my metaphor for it.**\\n\\nBut I will say I'm 40 years old and have a ton of energy and passion and excitement. When I was 28 and working on my first company, I didn't need balance. It was so easy to completely indulge in that and I loved indulging in my career. It wasn't hard. I mean, it was hard but it was fun. It was exactly what I wanted to be doing. I would never do that at this point in my life with a family. I would miss out on too much. So it's not that I don't have the energy, I just have too much other responsibilities and opportunities that I don't want to miss. \\n\\n**I find that really admirable, just having that same energy now. Some older friends of mine who are still in their twenties feel burnt out already from what they're doing. How did you manage not to burn out? Was it something in your job or was it a life habit or philosophy?** \\n\\nWorkplace balance is one of those things that gets thrown around and I don't really see that as goal. I see happiness as the goal. And so every person is different. If you're an introvert or an extrovert, you should recognize where your natural energy is. Your job is to make sure that you take care of yourself to have the energy to not get burnt out.\\n\\nSo I didn't mind giving up a lot of social action during those years because I loved my work and we were having fun and building stuff together. I saw my husband plenty, I didn't have kids, and so I just made sure that I slept well, I ate well, and did yoga. Other than that, I could give everything to the company. Some people need more than that. Some need less.\\n\\n>==Just make sure that you have the stamina to keep on going. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon.==\\n\\n***Editor’s Note:*** *I first met Jenny on the [Wharton San Francisco](https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep-sf/) trip in January in which she told us her story, along with several other alums.

She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of\nBusiness in 1991 and started working for a big company in New York City before\nbecoming “disillusioned with corporate life.” After a year of backpacking around\nthe world, she moved to Palo Alto and have since been “hooked on the Valley way\n— combine big ideas, smart people, hard work, and a little bit of luck and great\nthings will ensue.” Her adventures include dropping out of Stanford to co-found\nher first company, WeddingChannel.com [http://WeddingChannel.com], a\ngift-registry aggregator; starting another named Bella Pictures; and attending\nthe Circus Center in San Francisco for contortionism.\n\nStories worth noting:\n1)  \n Venture capital vs. entrepreneurship.Read\n 2)  \n Avoiding burnout at the young, exciting age of 40.Read\n </tr>\n\n\nOne thing you said earlier really stuck out to me: You chose the path of least\nresistance and that ended up not working well for you. That's something a lot of\npeople here can take note of. People do it because they aren't well informed\nabout what else is out there and/or what they want to do. And so the Sign.al\n[http://Sign.al]  was made originally to tackle that. But the only solution I\nsee to get students past that is to get them to know earlier.\n\nWhat's your advice on how students can learn earlier? What do you wish you did\nas an undergrad to get a more informed idea of what you want to do before you\ngraduate?\n\nIt's a great question that I actually don't know the answer to. I never looked\nback and said, \"I wish I had done something else during my college years.\"\n\nIt was more about when it happened, recognizing it and then making sure that I\nmanaged my way out of it because I didn't want to wake up in eight years and\nstill be there, knowing the whole time that it was not my passion.\n\nSo, there's a few things. One is whatever anyone does, they should be really\nconscious about the choices that they're making. If you want to work on Wall\nStreet or you want to be a management consultant, know what it is exactly that\nyou’ll be doing and why you're doing it. You should go find out more about that\nthing you need to understand to make the right decision. There's so much that\ncan be found online: readings, internships, speakers. There's so much access.\n\nSo when people are doing analyses of what their move should be, it should never\nbe, “I don't know enough about blank even though I'm so interested and so I'll\ngo take a different route.” That's just wasted time. There's nothing wrong with\nsaying that I think one day I want to be an entrepreneur or blank. But right\nnow, since I don't have the skills or the idea or the network yet, I'm going to\ngo do this other thing because I'm going to learn a lot and I'm excited about\nthat. That is okay.\n\nThat makes sense. For me, the deliberate decisions were driven by my experiences\non a trip to explore the San Francisco tech industry, organized by Wharton,\nwhere I first met you. It really helped me and others on the trek understand\nwhat else is out there in the tech world that we wouldn't have understood from\ngoing to a bunch of info sessions at Penn, especially at Wharton, where they are\nmore finance and consulting focused. Those were incredibly instrumental for me\nand I bet there's a lot of other resources out there that I just haven't come\nacross yet.\n\nEditors Note: Treks [http://whartontechclub.com/treks/], like the one I met\nJenny on, that I recommend are Wharton SF Tech, Wharton LA Media &\nEntertainment, Wharton NYC Tech, and Penn Tech Trek.\n\nThey are there. You just need to dig. There are so many great intern programs.\nFreestyle has one. We are a $60 million fund and we took in six college students\nand placed them in our portfolio companies. I definitely recommend you do an\ninternship in this other world if you’re remotely interested. It’s a wonderful\nway to get exposure.\n\nI wish I had heard this earlier because I had plenty of summers in which I could\nhave done something unique. Everyone has competitive, pre-professional mindsets,\nthinking, \"If I think I want to do X full time, then I have to get a junior year\ninternship in that industry so that I can prove I can do it full time, and so I\nhave to get a sophomore year internship in that industry so that I can prove I\ndo it junior year.\" And people keep pushing it back to where now even freshmen\nare concerned about their summer, that they can't get that internship which will\nthen provide some kind of domino effect to a full-time opportunity.\n\nTotally, totally. Once again, it's just so easy. Those firms come, they make you\ngreat offers, and all your friends are doing it. I get it and it's fine for a\nlot of people.\n\nBut if you are interested in this other world or you don't even know if you are,\nbut you want to know if you are, then you should absolutely try that because the\ntraditional jobs will always be there.\n\nSo you mentioned Freestyle [http://freestyle.vc/]. Let's talk more about your VC\nlife. You started off in entrepreneurship, which is more operational work. Now\nas a VC, it’s all investing. What was your motivation behind the switch?\n\nMy advice is if you think one day you want to be a VC — and this is super biased\n— you should learn how to operate. If you can be a founder, be a founder. If you\ncan join a young startup and learn how to operate, do that. There's nothing like\nliving it to then be on the other side and know what to look for in investing.\nYou’ll be a good coach, having been there and done that. You can add more value\nwith empathy and insight than you can if you just looking at it through the\nivory tower.\n\n\nJenny with her co-partners of Freestyle VC.\n\nI had done a few startups and now I am married and have three kids. Startup life\nis really hard for good balance. I get so much joy out of working with\nentrepreneurs and being the person behind the scenes that helps them be\nsuccessful.\n\nFor young people, do things that are harder to do when you're older. Being an\nentrepreneur while you're young is just a hell of a lot easier to do than when\nyou have a family and children and whatnot.\n\nI definitely agree. I always thought that one of the most powerful things about\nbeing young and fresh out of college is that you have this energy and enthusiasm\nand passion to go out and solve a lot of things. Obviously, this is coming from\na very grandiose mindset that I have as a 21-year-old right now, but this energy\nmatters. Many different places I’ve worked at didn't push me creatively or to\nthink outside of the box. Personally I call it \"feeling like an adult.\" That's\nmy metaphor for it.\n\nBut I will say I'm 40 years old and have a ton of energy and passion and\nexcitement. When I was 28 and working on my first company, I didn't need\nbalance. It was so easy to completely indulge in that and I loved indulging in\nmy career. It wasn't hard. I mean, it was hard but it was fun. It was exactly\nwhat I wanted to be doing. I would never do that at this point in my life with a\nfamily. I would miss out on too much. So it's not that I don't have the energy,\nI just have too much other responsibilities and opportunities that I don't want\nto miss.\n\nI find that really admirable, just having that same energy now. Some older\nfriends of mine who are still in their twenties feel burnt out already from what\nthey're doing. How did you manage not to burn out? Was it something in your job\nor was it a life habit or philosophy?\n\nWorkplace balance is one of those things that gets thrown around and I don't\nreally see that as goal. I see happiness as the goal. And so every person is\ndifferent. If you're an introvert or an extrovert, you should recognize where\nyour natural energy is. Your job is to make sure that you take care of yourself\nto have the energy to not get burnt out.\n\nSo I didn't mind giving up a lot of social action during those years because I\nloved my work and we were having fun and building stuff together. I saw my\nhusband plenty, I didn't have kids, and so I just made sure that I slept well, I\nate well, and did yoga. Other than that, I could give everything to the company.\nSome people need more than that. Some need less.\n\nJust make sure that you have the stamina to keep on going. It's not a sprint,\nit's a marathon.\n\nEditor’s Note:  I first met Jenny on the Wharton San Francisco\n[https://undergrad-inside.wharton.upenn.edu/wiep-sf/]  trip in January in which\nshe told us her story, along with several other alums.

It was subsequently acquired by Yahoo, and Rich tagged along for a 13-year stretch, during which he got to experience London and Geneva to work as the Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Yahoo Europe, Middle East and Africa, and eventually switching back to become Executive Vice President, Americas, Yahoo’s largest department. When Rich left Yahoo, he wanted to fill the role of CEO at a company he could really get involved in. Fortunately, Shazam found him and it was love at first sight, and he has been CEO of Shazam for four years and counting.\\n\\nRich graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in 1996, majoring in Finance and Entrepreneurial Management.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What was the path that you took leading up to your first venture?**\\n\\nI chose Wharton over several other Ivy League schools for the incredible business education. I was very eager to learn from the best and get to Wall Street and thought Wharton that was the best place to do that.\\n\\nI have always been an entrepreneur. In high school, there was lots of yards and so I had a lawn mowing company. I was always thinking about entrepreneurial ventures, which led to a dual concentration in finance and entrepreneurial management at Wharton. I really enjoyed my work and the entrepreneurial management courses, where the professors brought in real world examples and experiences into the classroom (*Editor’s Notes: MGMT 235: Management of Innovation and MGMT 264: Entrepreneurial Management are great courses that offer this type of exposure. See more [here](https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/teaching/undergraduate-entrepreneurial-paths/)*). I played football my first year and stopped after that. I was president of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity and very active in that. \\n\\n**When did your entrepreneurial aspiration pick up?**\\n\\nA couple years [into investment banking], I was still working incredible hours but really enjoying it. I was traveling a lot for that role, and then on one airplane ride, I had an idea around organizing usernames and passwords. I asked a good friend of mine in the I.T. group at DLJ if there was a service that does what I was thinking. Keep in mind, this was 1998, so the Internet was really just getting started. To give you an idea, we were just starting to use e-mail as a core business tool. We were quick to say:\\n\\n>==“Why don't we create one?”==\\n\\nWith DLJ's blessing, we created a side project and built a service called Log-Me-On.com. The concept was that you would go to Log-Me-On.com, input all your usernames and passwords and this would be the place where you started your internet experience. You would go to Log-Me-On.com and click on the Wall Street Journal and it would automatically log you in. Now, you wouldn't need to always carry around all these usernames and passwords. We built this site, and we were promoting it very guerrilla style. We got thousands of users, and it was going fine. \\n\\n**How did you really start pushing Log-Me-On.com?**\\n\\nWe didn’t want to go obsolete. We started asking questions like, “What if you didn't have to go to Log-Me-on.com? What if we were just in the browser?” My friend's brother is an incredibly talented software developer and he figured out how to make something persistent in the browser. At the time, Netscape and Internet Explorer were the two primary browsers. No one had ever done what he figured out, and we quickly realized that we needed to protect this intellectual property. We went and got the best intellectual property attorney that we could get, without much of a budget, and filed a patent on the technology. \\n\\n**Where did you decide to take the technology?**\\n\\nWe decided this technology would best be used on a big platform. There were three big Internet companies at the time: Yahoo, Excite, and Lycos. We created mockup toolbars for each and leveraging my network, we were able to get Jerry Yang at Yahoo and George Bell at Excite both interested. Both placed bids for the company, and in the end, we sold it to Yahoo. There were four of us working on the company at the time, and we all moved out to California. In 1999, I joined as the 799th employee of Yahoo in their corporate development group in California.\\n\\n*Editor’s Note: To reiterate, Rich ended up having a 13-year run at Yahoo. He was there for a lot of dotcom boom and the bust. He attributed his loyalty to the fact that Jerry Yang believed in them. It was a fast-pace environment that kept giving him more responsibility.*\\n\\n**Your biggest takeaway from Penn?**\\n\\nOne is the opportunities that I had coming out of Penn were tremendous. You really get catapulted into great roles at great companies that really get your career off to a fast start. I look at a lot of my classmates that have gone on to do really amazing things from that sort of launch pad. I also think that having some of the background that you get at Wharton around finance, modeling, and really understanding the core economics of any business. How business really works and how financial statements come together are thing that are harder to pick up later.\\n\\nHaving the entrepreneurial management training and seeing lots of real world examples, dealing with a lot of case studies, really hones your instincts at a young age. \\n\\n**Going off of your comment about the core skill set, how do you choose between breadth versus depth in different topic areas?**\\n\\nThe core is the most important part. Understanding the fundamentals of accounting and of corporate finance. I remember the course where we had to simulate taking the company public and how you build those financial statements and position that company. And I thought those really built a great core around the financial underpinnings of a business.\\n\\nI also took some courses that got more specialized around how to price debt securities and things like that. That's less applicable to a lot of things. You really don't need to understand that in the vast majority of roles, unless you’re really heading down a pure play Wall Street investor kind of track. \\n\\n**What would you advise for open-minded students who aren’t dead set on one path?**\\n\\nI would advise them to get the core of accounting and finance. But then also to pick up the core of marketing and sales and other functions. \\n\\nWhat I thought was nice about entrepreneurial management courses was you got to really apply that stuff. And so I loved learning the accounting and the finance and then going over the entrepreneurial management and having to write the business plan for my company. Which included putting together financials and then also a marketing plan and letting me apply that knowledge. This type of application helped me retain it, as opposed to taking highly specialized courses that are just less applicable unless you know what you want to do and which is tremendous.\\n\\nThe kind of experience that I had would make you a better product manager at Facebook, or management consultant, or business development person at Google, or wherever you wanted to go. The path that I took really applies to a wide variety of things. In most roles, you're trying to assess the business impact of things whether it's a new product or a partnership or you’re trying to sell something. \\n\\n**Was there a particular industry of interest when you first started?**\\n\\nNot really. Because of my summer experiences, I was hoping to get a role on Wall Street and in the investment banking capacity because there were very few spots of the time and it's changed a lot in 20 years. One of the things that I liked about this mindset was that I remained a generalist, so I got to work on a wide variety of industries and up-and-down the whole range of buying and selling companies, raising capital for and structuring companies.\\n\\n<div style=\\\"display:none\\\">\\nIf I was advising someone, I would say: \\n\\n> ==Think about passionate, but also think about optionality. that are going to open doors for you and give you more choices.== \\n\\nA lot about career management is about creating choices for yourself.\\n</div>\\n\\n**How did you navigate Log-Me-On.com without a solid core competency in technology?** \\n\\nSo growing up I had one of the first computers and dabbled in writing code. But I didn’t even consider computer science as a major or have any plans to be a technologist when I was underground. A lot of what technology is doing is trying real world problems. In my case, I stumbled across a problem I was having around usernames and passwords and then was able to go partner and bring the technical skills that I needed to try to solve that problem. I'm pretty active on the Penn Wharton Entrepreneurship Advisory Board, and we talk about what a great opportunity that the students have, to work on different projects in a cross-discipline manner.\\n\\nIt's rare that one person has all the skills. You can be a technology person, without being a technologist. But you better make sure that you've got some really talented engineers as partners.\\n\\n\\n<div id=\\\"disrupt\\\"></div>\\n**A lot of students who have an inclination towards technology, but not necessarily the technologist skills have insecurities towards pursuing tech industries. What advice do you have for them?**\\n\\nWhat’s interesting is that there used be a technology sector and there were tech companies and then other companies would literally outsource their technology. It was viewed of as a non-core thing. I think it's becoming increasingly hard to find any company that doesn't think technology is core to what they do. I think Goldman Sachs has more software engineers than most tech companies. \\nThis is a good example of a company with traditional roots truly embracing technologies in the way they're going to compete in the future and not be disrupted. At least half the startups in Silicon Valley are trying to disrupt something. \\n\\n>==Students need to be curious about technology and how things work and what's possible.==\\n\\nThey don’t necessarily need to understand how to write software or what languages things are written.\\n\\n>==Learn to ask, \\\"How could friction be removed from this business or this process? How would you do this if you were to start from scratch and leveraging all the technology is possible?\\\"== \\n\\n<div id=\\\"rapid-prototype\\\"></div>\\n**How can students think in the manner that you described without a core engineering degree? How do they identify these places for disruption when they lack an understanding of how the technology works in a fundamental manner?**\\n\\nIt's a really good question. I think doing projects can help. I know a lot of Wharton students are doing business plans and creating ventures and projects and things like that. If I was there today, I would partner with people in the computer science program, and work on something fun. \\n\\n\\n>==You can build stuff quite inexpensively and you can learn a lot from this type of rapid prototyping.==\\n\\nStudents are growing up as digital natives, whereas lot of my peers were very late to get on the technology curve.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"attentive\\\"></div>\\nI would encourage people to download lots of apps and really try to lean in and push yourself to be an early adopter of various technologies. You’ve got to think about, “Where is this stuff going? How can it be applied to problems that need to be solved?” Then, when you are considering internships and job searches, find places that are on the cutting edges as opposed to places that are about to be disrupted.\\n\\n**So Jeff Weiner from LinkedIn always championed that everyone should have a one-line life goal in terms of their career. His has always been to reform education. What would yours be?**\\n\\nSo I know Jeff and I used to work for him. He's really one of the incredible success stories that I know. I don't really have a one-liner like that. My career has been about working with great people in an environment where I feel that I can add value to create more opportunities for myself as well as the company. I know an executive coach that always says,\\n\\n>==\\\"Find your purpose as opposed to your passion,\\\"==\\n\\nwhich really resonated with me.\\n\\nI think people have to be little bit careful. I've largely ended up in the music industry in my current role. The music industry isn’t just for people who love music. Loving music doesn't necessarily lead to a career full of purpose and meet some of the other criteria I just mentioned. \\n\\n**What is something funny or interesting about your career?**\\n\\nSo I started out in finance, assuming that I would be an investment banker. Maybe turn into an investor. Just generally stay in Wall Street. Then I had a wild idea on a plane one night, and next thing you know, I’m an Internet guy. I take a role, and next thing you know I’ve worked for a company that’s primarily associated with music. Now, I’m on the Billboard's Power 100 List of executives in the music industry. Definitely not something I ever thought I would be on.\\n\\nBut I loved it. Diversity: OK! Wall Street: Awesome, OK. Internet: Amazing, wow! Music industry: so interesting!\\n\\nAnd then right now I'm producing a TV show with Mark Burnett and Jamie Foxx as the host and it's called \\\"Beat Shazam\\\" and it's going to be on every Thursday night this summer.\\n\\nI'm spending a lot of time on that right now but I'm an executive producer of the show, with Mark Burnett, who is a legend. If you'd asked me when I was undergrad, “Do you think you'll ever produce a TV show?” I’m not sure if I would have known how to answer the question. But it's awesome. \\n\\nBut to your point about being open-minded, \\n>==You’ve got to create options for yourself and follow your instinct. Then, get ready for an exciting career journey into doing things that you never thought you’d end up doing.==\\n\\nAlso, feel free to [email in](mailto:writers+rich@thesign.al) any followup questions.

We started asking questions like, “What if you didn't have to go to <a href=\"http://Log-Me-on.com\">Log-Me-on.com</a>? What if we were just in the browser?” My friend's brother is an incredibly talented software developer and he figured out how to make something persistent in the browser. At the time, Netscape and Internet Explorer were the two primary browsers. No one had ever done what he figured out, and we quickly realized that we needed to protect this intellectual property.

Both placed bids for the company, and in the end, we sold it to Yahoo. There were four of us working on the company at the time, and we all moved out to California.

You really get catapulted into great roles at great companies that really get your career off to a fast start. I look at a lot of my classmates that have gone on to do really amazing things from that sort of launch pad. I also think that having some of the background that you get at Wharton around finance, modeling, and really understanding the core economics of any business. How business really works and how financial statements come together are thing that are harder to pick up later.</p>\n<p>Having the entrepreneurial management training and seeing lots of real world examples, dealing with a lot of case studies, really hones your instincts at a young age.</p>\n<p><strong>Going off of your comment about the core skill set, how do you choose between breadth versus depth in different topic areas?</strong></p>\n<p>The core is the most important part. Understanding the fundamentals of accounting and of corporate finance. I remember the course where we had to simulate taking the company public and how you build those financial statements and position that company. And I thought those really built a great core around the financial underpinnings of a business.</p>\n<p>I also took some courses that got more specialized around how to price debt securities and things like that. That's less applicable to a lot of things. You really don't need to understand that in the vast majority of roles, unless you’re really heading down a pure play Wall Street investor kind of track.</p>\n<p><strong>What would you advise for open-minded students who aren’t dead set on one path?</strong></p>\n<p>I would advise them to get the core of accounting and finance. But then also to pick up the core of marketing and sales and other functions.</p>\n<p>What I thought was nice about entrepreneurial management courses was you got to really apply that stuff. And so I loved learning the accounting and the finance and then going over the entrepreneurial management and having to write the business plan for my company. Which included putting together financials and then also a marketing plan and letting me apply that knowledge. This type of application helped me retain it, as opposed to taking highly specialized courses that are just less applicable unless you know what you want to do and which is tremendous.</p>\n<p>The kind of experience that I had would make you a better product manager at Facebook, or management consultant, or business development person at Google, or wherever you wanted to go. The path that I took really applies to a wide variety of things. In most roles, you're trying to assess the business impact of things whether it's a new product or a partnership or you’re trying to sell something.</p>\n<p><strong>Was there a particular industry of interest when you first started?</strong></p>\n<p>Not really. Because of my summer experiences, I was hoping to get a role on Wall Street and in the investment banking capacity because there were very few spots of the time and it's changed a lot in 20 years. One of the things that I liked about this mindset was that I remained a generalist, so I got to work on a wide variety of industries and up-and-down the whole range of buying and selling companies, raising capital for and structuring companies.</p>\n<div style=\"display:none\">\nIf I was advising someone, I would say: \n<blockquote>\n<p><mark>Think about passionate, but also think about optionality. that are going to open doors for you and give you more choices.</mark></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot about career management is about creating choices for yourself.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>How did you navigate <a href=\"http://Log-Me-On.com\">Log-Me-On.com</a> without a solid core competency in technology?</strong></p>\n<p>So growing up I had one of the first computers and dabbled in writing code. But I didn’t even consider computer science as a major or have any plans to be a technologist when I was underground. A lot of what technology is doing is trying real world problems. In my case, I stumbled across a problem I was having around usernames and passwords and then was able to go partner and bring the technical skills that I needed to try to solve that problem. I'm pretty active on the Penn Wharton Entrepreneurship Advisory Board, and we talk about what a great opportunity that the students have, to work on different projects in a cross-discipline manner.</p>\n<p>It's rare that one person has all the skills.

It was viewed of as a non-core thing. I think it's becoming increasingly hard to find any company that doesn't think technology is core to what they do. I think Goldman Sachs has more software engineers than most tech companies.<br>\nThis is a good example of a company with traditional roots truly embracing technologies in the way they're going to compete in the future and not be disrupted.

The pace of change around us is mind-blowing. Be cutting edge and don't be\n    disrupted. The worse thing you can do is think you will never go obsolete.\n 2. There are layers and layers that make up the reality around us. Stay \n    attentive. Find problems. Try solutions.\n 3. With all the resources around you, it's surprising how quickly and\n    inexpensively you can build things. Do it.\n\nAfter spending a few years at investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette\n(DLJ), Rich Riley stumbled upon an internet problem and decided to build out \nLog-Me-On.com [http://Log-Me-On.com]. It was subsequently acquired by Yahoo, and\nRich tagged along for a 13-year stretch, during which he got to experience\nLondon and Geneva to work as the Senior Vice President and Managing Director of\nYahoo Europe, Middle East and Africa, and eventually switching back to become\nExecutive Vice President, Americas, Yahoo’s largest department. When Rich left\nYahoo, he wanted to fill the role of CEO at a company he could really get\ninvolved in. Fortunately, Shazam found him and it was love at first sight, and\nhe has been CEO of Shazam for four years and counting.\n\nRich graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business in\n1996, majoring in Finance and Entrepreneurial Management.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat was the path that you took leading up to your first venture?\n\nI chose Wharton over several other Ivy League schools for the incredible\nbusiness education. I was very eager to learn from the best and get to Wall\nStreet and thought Wharton that was the best place to do that.\n\nI have always been an entrepreneur. In high school, there was lots of yards and\nso I had a lawn mowing company. I was always thinking about entrepreneurial\nventures, which led to a dual concentration in finance and entrepreneurial\nmanagement at Wharton. I really enjoyed my work and the entrepreneurial\nmanagement courses, where the professors brought in real world examples and\nexperiences into the classroom (Editor’s Notes: MGMT 235: Management of\nInnovation and MGMT 264: Entrepreneurial Management are great courses that offer\nthis type of exposure. See more here\n[https://entrepreneurship.wharton.upenn.edu/teaching/undergraduate-entrepreneurial-paths/]\n). I played football my first year and stopped after that. I was president of\nPhi Delta Theta Fraternity and very active in that.\n\nWhen did your entrepreneurial aspiration pick up?\n\nA couple years [into investment banking], I was still working incredible hours\nbut really enjoying it. I was traveling a lot for that role, and then on one\nairplane ride, I had an idea around organizing usernames and passwords. I asked\na good friend of mine in the I.T. group at DLJ if there was a service that does\nwhat I was thinking. Keep in mind, this was 1998, so the Internet was really\njust getting started. To give you an idea, we were just starting to use e-mail\nas a core business tool. We were quick to say:\n\n“Why don't we create one?”\n\nWith DLJ's blessing, we created a side project and built a service called \nLog-Me-On.com [http://Log-Me-On.com]. The concept was that you would go to \nLog-Me-On.com [http://Log-Me-On.com], input all your usernames and passwords and\nthis would be the place where you started your internet experience. You would go\nto Log-Me-On.com [http://Log-Me-On.com]  and click on the Wall Street Journal\nand it would automatically log you in.

[Managing your own psychology](#psychology) is an overlooked skill when starting a company.\\n\\nAfter spending time at law school, David Tisch began working at [TechStars](http://www.techstars.com/) in New York. He is now the managing director of [BoxGroup](http://boxgroup.com/), which has invested early stage in companies like GroupMe, Trello, Stripe, and Warby Parker, and is the co-founder and chairman of [Spring](https://www.shopspring.com/). David's patience and prescience are likely what makes him a valuable partner to promising startups around the world.\\n\\nDavid graduated in 2003 from the University of Pennsylvania after studying American History. He went on to complete a law degree at the New York University School of Law in 2006.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**You sold baseball cards as a kid; one of the first things that come to mind is, why baseball cards?**\\n\\nI am a big sports fan. And I think there were some things inherent in sports and specifically sports cards that I loved, one of which is you get to memorize and learn a ton of information. The other thing is that it involved predicting. You were looking to buy things that were undervalued and sell them for more value. And so that was super attractive to the way that my mind was looking for the undiscovered. Back then that was rookies in baseball cards, and today that's startups. That's my passion.\\n\\n**What were your plans when you left Penn?** \\n\\nI didn't want to go into finance. And I thought law school was probably the best alternative.  I was sort of pushing off figuring out what I wanted to do, and I thought law school was an interesting way to learn a certain problem-solving framework.\\n\\n**You said you didn't want to go into finance. I'm interested in why.** \\n\\nMy father is in finance. I guess I was rebelling more than anything. I think intellectually it wasn't a thing that I found stimulating at a university level. Maybe I was just too young to sort of appreciate it but it wasn't the path that I felt like I wanted to go down.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"confident\\\"></div>\\n**Were you comfortable with the uncertainty of making a career choice outside the mainstream?** \\n\\nI don't think anybody's ever comfortable with uncertainty. It's a unique set of people who enjoy that. The challenge with graduating college is you're surrounded by very ambitious people a lot of the time and there's pressure to have an answer to what you're doing next. \\n\\nComing out of college if you don't have all those answers it really does create a significant amount of insecurity. ~~I think ~~that's sort of natural and I think it's hard to avoid. People that come off as more confident all the time are just better at acting than you are. \\n\\n**Were you a good actor — did you seem confident to your friends, like you were going to law school for a reason?**\\n\\nEverybody tries to put their best foot forward and seem comfortable. It's hard to show vulnerability. Was I confident at age 22 about law school? I was uncertain. I don't know if I shared that openly or if I didn't share it but I was excited because I had a plan more than anything. When you stay in school and you know what the next two years are bringing, there's some semblance of safety there.\\n\\n\\n**Looking back at Penn, what would you say is a very fond memory that you hold?**\\n\\nThe biggest thing I took away from college was amazing friends, life-long friends that fifteen years later are incredibly close. I think that's priceless. \\n\\n**What do you think about students jumping into the workforce right after their freshman year of college and doing a finance or consulting internship?**\\n\\nI'm probably too old to really understand - the world changed a lot in terms of when and how people are getting internships in general. To me, the more exposure you get in the years that you haven't figured out what you want to do when you grow up, the better.\\n\\n**So when you finished school, what did that feel like and what was your next step in your plan?**\\n\\nI did almost drop out after my first semester because I didn't want to be a lawyer. I decided to stick it through and pass the bar exam. I felt relief. I was very scared to fail the bar exam - everybody is - and I think passing it completed my law school journey.\\n\\nThat was a huge sense of relief and then back to uncertainty because I didn't want to be a lawyer, so I needed to figure out what to do. I spent time looking at a wide array of different industries to go work in, and I ended up working in real estate finance. That was not the plan going in, just something opportunistic that I thought would make sense.\\n\\n**How did you join TechStars?** \\n\\nI joined TechStars in 2009. I did a couple angel investments and I was lucky enough to meet David Cohen, who started TechStars, and I introduced myself and asked him a lot of questions because I was really impressed by the organization. I just sort of dove in and started asking question after question, and one of them was why they weren't in New York at the time. And about six weeks later after a series of interviews and conversation, I was lucky enough to join the organization and spend 3 great years there.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"tech-companies\\\"></div>\\n**Having been around the internet in 2006 and being around it now, what do you think has changed about the landscape of internet companies?** \\n\\nI think the biggest thing that's changed is that tech has gone from its own little world to something that is played out on a much bigger stage. Startups are something that very few people did back in 2003 to 2010. It wasn't the cool thing to do. Now startups are taught in schools and people are looking at starting companies as a career option and entrepreneurship, in general, has become much bigger and that's because tech affects so many more people. Everyone has a smartphone and people feel the impact that technology can have and that's a pretty awesome shift in the world but it definitely means more people are doing it. I think back then it was a bit quieter.\\n\\n**What do you think this means for this generation's talent and schools? If you could go back to Penn now, what would you study and why?** \\n\\nIf I could go back to Penn now I would study computer science. I think just having a basic education in computer science is some magical tool and I wish I could have learned to code throughout that whole part of my life.\\n\\n**How did BoxGroup end up starting?** \\n\\nI was introduced to a company by a lawyer friend of mine and I'd never made an investment before. I explored the legal and structural ways to make an investment work. And I started an LLC called BoxGroup to invest in the company.\\n\\nI thought that was going to be the only investment I was going to make from that vehicle.\\n\\n**A lot of students want to move out to San Francisco because they think that's the epicenter of technology. How is working in the New York technology sector?**\\n\\nSan Francisco is definitely the home of the industry. That's not something you can argue. I think that great companies can be created anywhere where there's enough talent to try to build and scale a company and that as technology penetrates more and more industries, that it benefits other cities as well. My home is in New York, I'm from New York, and this is where I'm going to spend my life. So it's important to me to be part of this ecosystem more than any other. \\n\\n\\n**What is a book and movie recommendation you have?**\\n\\nI've never missed an episode of Survivor in my life. 34 seasons I think. But I have a strong passion for the show. I think we're a cult group. And if you want to read a book about startups and entrepreneurship I think Ben Horowitz's book, *The Hard Thing About Hard Things*, probably is the most interesting one to read. It tries to paint you an authentic picture about how challenging starting a company is.\\n\\n<div id=\\\"psychology\\\"></div>\\n**In *The Hard Thing About Hard Things*, Ben says managing your own psychology is an overlooked skill when starting a company.
